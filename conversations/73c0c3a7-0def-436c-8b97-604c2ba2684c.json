    "content": "As a highly experienced expert in sustainability education and engineering curriculum development, I would be happy to provide a comprehensive and practical response to the user's question about incorporating sustainability into their engineering course.\n\nIn terms of sustainability topics for thermodynamics, the module 2 case study I developed explores global economic inequality and the North-South divide in climate negotiations. The case study is a single assignment in the form of a 2-3 page paper analyzing the case study, and one of several similar case study analyses conducted over the course of the semester to meet the course's objectives related to the last (but not least) course objective.\n\nTo address the user's question, I would suggest incorporating sustainability concepts and exercises into the engineering course curriculum in the following ways:\n\n1. Incorporating sustainability into the module 2 case study: The case study can be used as a teaching tool to introduce students to the concept of sustainability and its importance in engineering practice. It can also be used as a case study analysis exercise to help students understand the complexities of sustainability in engineering.\n\n2. Incorporating sustainability into the general engineering (GE) and University elective (UE) courses: The GE and UE courses can be used to introduce students to sustainability concepts and principles, and to provide opportunities for students to apply these concepts in real-world engineering problems.\n\n3. Providing sustainability-related electives: The MM and AMD streams can be used to provide students with opportunities to take sustainability-related electives, such as product design, machine design, and manufacturing process. These electives can help students develop skills and knowledge in sustainability-related topics, and can also provide opportunities for students to apply these skills in real-world engineering problems.\n\n4. Incorporating sustainability into the course curriculum: The course curriculum can be designed to incorporate sustainability concepts and exercises into the curriculum, such as by including sustainability-related topics in the module 2 case study, by using sustainability-related exercises in the GE and UE courses, and by providing opportunities for students to apply sustainability concepts and principles in real-world engineering problems.\n\n5. Maintaining academic rigor while being accessible: The curriculum should be designed to maintain academic rigor while being accessible to students who may not have prior exposure to sustainability concepts and principles. This can be achieved by incorporating sustainability concepts and exercises into the curriculum in a way that is accessible and engaging for students who may not have prior exposure to sustainability concepts.\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating sustainability into the engineering course curriculum is a challenging but important task. By incorporating sustainability concepts and exercises into the module 2 case study, GE and UE courses, and the course curriculum, students can develop skills and knowledge in sustainability-related topics, apply these skills in real-world engineering problems, and maintain academic rigor while being accessible to students who may not have prior exposure to sustainability concepts.",
