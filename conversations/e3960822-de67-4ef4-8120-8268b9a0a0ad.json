    "content": "Based on sustainability research in engineering education, here are specific ways to incorporate sustainability into your Fluid Mechanics course:\n\n**Key Integration Areas:**\n\n\u2022 **Energy Efficiency**: Focus on pump and turbine efficiency, renewable energy applications, and sustainable fluid systems\n\u2022 **Environmental Impact**: Cover water treatment, pollution control, and sustainable water management practices\n\u2022 **Real-world Applications**: Include case studies of sustainable fluid systems in buildings, infrastructure, and renewable energy\n\u2022 **Green Technologies**: Explore wind turbines, hydroelectric power, and sustainable HVAC systems\n\n**Research-Based Insights:**\n\n**Finding 1**: sustainability rating systems,\u201d ICSI 2014 Creat.  Infrastruct.\n\n**Finding 2**: , students, and management).  Overall recommendation from the authors, for a meaningful inclusion of sustainability concepts in the ME program, is to make the changes minimal but effective.\n\nThese recommendations are based on academic research in sustainability engineering education.
