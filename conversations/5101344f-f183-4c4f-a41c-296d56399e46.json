Overall recommendation from the authors, for a meaningful inclusion of sustainability concepts in the ME program, is to make the changes minimal but effective. The approach should be two-pronged: inclusion of sustainability modules in relevant courses; and introduction of a full course on sustainable engineering as a final-year elective, without disturbing the curricul\n\nThese recommendations are based on academic research in sustainability engineering education.
