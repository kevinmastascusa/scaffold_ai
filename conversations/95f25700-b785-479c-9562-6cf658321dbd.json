The following practical suggestions can be implemented to ensure that sustainability is addressed as the core theme that runs through the curriculum:\n\n1. Introduce sustainability as a core theme in the curriculum\n\nThe first step towards incorporating sustainability into engineering curriculum development is to introduce it as a core theme. This can be done by incorporating sustainability concepts and exercises into existing courses or by creating new courses specifically designed to address sustainability. For example, a course on sustainable materials design could incorporate sustainability concepts such as material selection, waste reduction, and environmental impact assessment.\n\n2. Focus on sustainability in intensive courses\n\nIntensive courses, such as workshops, product design, and final year projects, can be used to introduce sustainability concepts and exercises to students. These courses can be designed to be interactive and engaging, allowing students to apply sustainability concepts in real-world scenarios. For example, a workshop on sustainable product design could involve students in designing and prototyping sustainable products, while a final year project could involve students designing and implementing sustainable solutions for a real-world problem.\n\n3. Foster sustainability awareness among students\n\nTo ensure that sustainability is addressed as the core theme, it is essential to foster sustainability awareness among students. This can be done through various means, such as incorporating sustainability concepts and exercises into course materials, providing opportunities for students to engage in sustainability-related activities, and encouraging students to participate in sustainability-related events on campus. For example, a course on sustainable materials design could include sustainability-related activities such as designing and prototyping sustainable products, and encouraging students to participate in sustainability-related events on campus.\n\n4. Incorporate sustainability into course evaluations\n\nCourse evaluations can be used to assess the effectiveness of sustainability-related activities in the curriculum. By incorporating sustainability concepts and exercises into course evaluations, students can provide feedback on the effectiveness of sustainability-related activities, and help identify areas for improvement. For example, a course on sustainable materials design could include sustainability-related activities such as designing and prototyping sustainable products, and incorporating sustainability-related activities into course evaluations.\n\n5. Provide opportunities for sustainability-related research\n\nTo encourage sustainability-related research, it is essential to provide opportunities for students to engage in sustainability-related research. This can be done through various means, such as providing funding for sustainability-related research projects, offering research opportunities to students, and encouraging students to participate in sustainability-related research events on campus. For example, a course on sustainable materials design could include sustainability-related research projects, and encouraging students to participate in sustainability-related research events on campus.\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating sustainability into engineering curriculum development is a critical step towards achieving a sustainable future. By introducing sustainability as a core theme, focusing on sustainability in intensive courses, fostering sustainability awareness among students, incorporating sustainability into course evaluations, and providing opportunities for sustainability-related research, engineering curriculum can be transformed to address sustainability as the",
