Case Study Green Building and Sustainable Infrastructure: Sustainability Education for Civil Engineers J. T. Kevern, A.M.ASCE1 Abstract: This paper discusses a framework for incorporating sustainable design/thinking as a new civil engineering course and experiences from the pilot offering. Important areas are outlined to aid all engineers in understanding sustainability in context with traditional engineeringprinciples. Green-building rating systems were used to introduce the concepts of sustainability in buildings and infrastructure, highlighted by presentations from green-building professionals. By providing a better understanding of sustainability through education, civil engineers can provide proactive solutions to a growing global infrastructure.

Students were given the choice of basing an end -of-term research project on either the building which served as their senior capstone design c ourse subject building, or on a building design or construction topic derived from a collection of industrial art housed in the Grohmann Museum, located on the MSOE campus.

of the class. Incorporating sustainability into civil engineering curriculum poses a challenge to overcome the already constrained curriculum of 120 to 128 credits in most schools. Two basic strategies have been found in the literature from the faculties attempting to incorporate sustainability [2]. The first approach is the stand -alone method where a separate thre e credit course is offered to educate the students on sustainability while the other is module method. In the latter method, modules are designed to fit into one lecture or over a series of lectures sometimes via guest appearances. Dancz et al. (2017) reported in their study that students incorporated sustainability in senior design only if it is an expectation from the instructor [2]. The authors reported raising the bar of sustainability by engaging a sustainability expert could be a viable option for the instructor to adopt sustainability in their class. Scott et al. (2013)...
