Students \nidentify how their design choices in one system can affect the others. This is practiced in \nclass through a class game, and incorporated as one of the project deliverables.  \nExample of p rompt: Create a simple causal loop diagram illustrating how your proposed \nredesign solutions affect the systems reviewed in the class (water, air, heat, etc) . For each \nsolution, explore the tradeoffs and synergies  between systems (for example, how a \nMATERIAL choice to improve HEAT properties will re...",
