## 📊 **Technical Specifications**

### **Model Configuration**
```python
# Added to scaffold_core/config.py
LLM_MODELS = {
    "llama3.1-8b": {
        "name": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B",
        "desc": "Meta's latest 8B model with excellent reasoning and instruction following."
    },
    "llama3.1-70b": {
        "name": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B", 
        "desc": "Meta's flagship 70B model with state-of-the-art performance."
    }
}

# Updated parameters
LLM_MAX_LENGTH = 4096  # Increased for Llama 3.1
LLM_MAX_NEW_TOKENS = 2048  # Increased for longer responses
MAX_RESPONSE_WORDS = 4000  # Increased for comprehensive answers
```

### **Prompt Formatting**
```python
# Llama 3.1 specific format
formatted_prompt = f"""<|system|>
You are an expert in sustainability education and engineering curriculum development.
Provide comprehensive, well-structured responses with practical examples and educational strategies.

<|user|>
{query}

<|assistant|>"""
```

## 🚀 **Performance Results**

### **Test Results**
- ✅ **Model Loading:** Successful (10-20 seconds on MPS)
- ✅ **Response Generation:** High quality curriculum responses
- ✅ **Token Handling:** Proper attention masks and padding
- ✅ **Device Optimization:** Automatic MPS/GPU detection

### **Sample Response Quality**
```
Question: "What is life cycle assessment and how can it be integrated into engineering education?"

Response: "Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a method for assessing the environmental impacts 
of a product or service over its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal. 
It is a tool that can be used to compare the environmental impacts of different products or 
services and to identify areas where improvements can be made. Integrating LCA into engineering 
education can help students understand the environmental impacts of their designs and make 
more sustainable choices."
```

## 🔧 **System Improvements**

### **Query System Enhancements**
- ✅ Removed artificial top-k limitations
