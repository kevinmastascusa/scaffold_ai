Utilizing a case study approach with the Hafencity project in Hamburg, Germany, the research evaluates IVR as an educational tool to deliver an immersive learning experience in carbon-neutral development and sustainable strategies. A multidisciplinary team designed the IVR experience, incorporating real-world case studies and leveraging state-of-the-art sustainable development practices. The experiment involved a diverse group of students who, through IVR, engaged with five critical modules of sustainability. The effectiveness of the IVR experience was assessed through questionnaires focusing on ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use, employing a seven-point Likert scale. Results indicate that IVR significantly enhances understanding and engagement in sustainability topics, providing an effective educational environment that fosters active learning. This experiment contributes to the growing body of knowledge on IVR as a tool in sustainability education, pointing towards future developments such as incorporating the memory palace concept for improved student engagement and recall. The study also outlines the limitations and potential areas for enhancement in IVR-based sustainability education. © 2025 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Carbon-neutral development; Experiential learning theory; Immersive virtual reality (IVR)","Engineering education; Teaching; Carbon neutrals; Carbon-neutral development; Case study approach; Educational tools; Experiential learning; Experiential learning theories; Immersive virtual reality; Sustainability education; Virtual reality experiences; Students",Article,"",Scopus

Engineering educators are thus tasked with educating engineering students on the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that will make them change makers of the future. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to examine the learning opportunity structures that engineering students experience, as well as how students' opportunities to learn about sustainability-related issues are related to cognitive and behavioral learning outcomes. Methods: We surveyed engineering students at a large, public Midwestern university at the beginning and end of an academic year. Using structural equation modeling, this analysis focuses on engineering students' self-reported opportunities to learn about sustainability-related issues, as well as their self-reported learning outcomes. Results: We document sociodemographic differences in students' sustainability learning outcomes, including statistically significant sex differences in leadership and activism behaviors among engineering students. Additionally, various opportunities to learn about sustainability appear to be related to different learning outcomes, with implications for faculty pedagogies and learning activities. Finally, the relationship between cocurricular participation in sustainability-related activities and cognitive and behavioral learning outcomes appears to be mediated by students' opportunities for learning about sustainability. Conclusion: Engineering educators must carefully conceptualize the relationship between various opportunities to learn about sustainability and the specific learning outcomes those learning opportunities may foster. Moreover, opportunities to engage in sustainability-related actions outside of the classroom may enhance students' learning in engineering education. © 2025 American Society for Engineering Education.","structural equation modeling; sustainability competencies; sustainability education","Behavioral research; Curricula; Green development; Sociology; Students; Teaching; Engineering educators; Learn+; Learning opportunity; Learning outcome; Structural equation models; Student experiences; Student outcomes; Sustainability competency; Sustainability education; Sustainability learning; Engineering education",Article,"",Scopus

Specifically, it focuses on recycling through reclaiming electronic components from e-waste and reusing them in repairs or in the design and construction of new devices. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review is performed according to the PRISMA methodology. In total, 27 articles are analysed as to publication parameters, characteristics and evaluation of educational interventions on e-waste and evaluation results across major domains of learning (cognitive, affective and 21st century skills). Findings: The reviewed subject is under-research; publications are rare and mostly in conference proceedings. The majority of interventions take place at university level, in face-to-face mode, using a practical approach in hands-on labs. Educational methods draw from modern, learner-centred pedagogies such as collaborative learning and constructionism. Topics focus on innovative design and construction, while interventions tend to become embedded in engineering curricula/courses. Evaluation of learners’ gains across domains of learning is rare and follows informal procedures that shake the reliability of results. Domains other than the cognitive are scarcely and subjectively evaluated. Originality/value: Contrary to other aspects of sustainability, the aspect of e-waste has not been reviewed. The applied, hands-on approach and the analytic, synthetic, collaboration and creativity skills it requires are all much valued in education. The current review, therefore, comes to inform, inspire and guide educators and researchers in planning and implementing activities on this subject. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Domains of learning; e-Waste; Education; Educational intervention; Electronic components; Engineering education; Evaluation; Reclaiming; Recycling; Reusing; Sustainability; Systematic literature review; WEEE",,Review,"",Scopus

Campus-based initiatives make meaningful contributions to global climate goals by reducing carbon emissions fostering collaboration between academia, industry, government and civil society. The purpose of this study is to examine the impacts of campus-based learning activity on “students attributes”, particularly research, critical thinking and interpersonal skills empowering them to work aligned with sustainability development goals. Design/methodology/approach: A collaborative learning activity was planned and assigned to a group of civil engineering students using the university campus as a living laboratory to estimate carbon sequestration potential (CSP). Findings: The exercise turned out as a “green audit” in the campus, where students learned more about the significance of the challenges associated with reducing carbon emissions. In all, 47 tree species were identified, with a total CSP of approximately 91.042 tons. This activity equipped students with the knowledge, skills and values necessary to contribute meaningfully to carbon sequestration efforts within their university campus and beyond, fostering a culture of sustainability and environmental stewardship. Originality/value: The activity-based assessment stands out by incorporating civil engineering perspectives to analyze carbon sequestration within the context of infrastructure, land use and sustainable campus planning bridging environmental science with engineering applications. The carbon foot printing exercise evolved as the sustainability learning initiative of the new educational policy framework and improved soft and interpersonal skills as the learning outcomes for the students, inspiring them to become active agents of positive change in the fight against global warming. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon footprint; Carbon sequestration; Civil engineering education; Outdoor activity-based learning; Sustainability education",,Article,"",Scopus

The tool enables users to efficiently solve problems of varying complexity that would be cumbersome to address manually, thus, aligning with industrial practice where engineers rely on commercial software to streamline analysis and design processes. Demonstrations using the tool show that it can accurately produce composite and grand composite curves and compute heating/cooling utility targets, heat recovery targets and pinch points, for any given process data. It can also determine heat exchanger networks that realise these targets. A key distinguishing feature of the tool is its integration of Heat Pumps, which is particularly relevant given the growing trend toward the electrification of heat in industrial systems. Through several case studies, students applied the tool to optimise process energy systems, demonstrating its potential to enhance learning outcomes while providing valuable insights into energy efficiency and decarbonisation strategies. Applied in an industrial decarbonisation challenge in collaboration with a food manufacturer, the tool generates heat exchanger and heat pump integration solutions resulting in significant energy savings—up to 48 % in heating utilities and 100 % in cooling utilities. Overall, the simulation tool effectively bridges the gap between academic learning and industry practice, offering a unique and impactful approach to sustainability education. © 2025 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Challenge-based learning; Educational software; Energy engineering; Heat integration; Industrial decarbonisation; Pinch technology","Air source heat pumps; Demonstrations; Educational robots; Engineering education; Mobile applications; Software testing; Students; Utility programs; Challenge-based learning; Decarbonisation; Educational software; Energy engineering; Heat integration; Heat pumps; Industrial decarbonization; Industrial process development; Pinch analysis; Pinch technology; Enterprise software",Article,"",Scopus

The waste sector is a major consumer of natural resources and emitter of greenhouse gases, which is why it is a central theme in the training of engineering students. This paper presents the main takeaways from a pilot training module based on design fiction. The module aims to develop futures thinking in engineering students by helping them to imagine waste management in different climatic and technological contexts. An analysis of the futures images based on written output shows that the training module enables students to generate different technological schemes for waste recovery, which are conceived in their social and cultural context. Students nevertheless struggle to imagine futures that are radically different from lifestyles in a consumer society. Only output imagining a future of collapse explores ways of living that depart from our current lifestyles. Articulating the temporalities of technological and climatic processes and understanding low-tech approaches appear to be two opportunities for perfecting the module. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Design fiction; Education for sustainable development; Engineering education; Futures thinking; Higher education",,Article,"",Scopus

Exposing engineering students to simulated real world challenges where they must fully define a problem, ideate, and storyboard potential solutions helps them develop and refine their engineering capabilities. Grouping students from different stages and programmes of study, where the implicit peer-to-peer learning can be of tremendous benefit to students, facilitates a broader range of experience. Furthermore, as part of their professional formation such collaboration exposes students to other available educational opportunities. Engagement with enterprise partners to address some of the challenges these partners face, exposes university students to relevant approximations of professional practice relating to sustainability. Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin) has piloted activities with enterprises to help equip students address and solve sustainability issues and encourage them to develop and practice the attitudes, technical and non-technical skills required. The aim of this work is to explain how TU Dublin encourages competence building relating to sustainability within the undergraduate mechanical engineering student cohort through extra-curricular enterprise-engagement activities. More specifically, this chapter describes a pilot programme initiated by the School of Mechanical Engineering in TU Dublin during the academic year 2022–23, in co-operation with an industry partner. The goal was to reinforce the importance of the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals and help engineering students develop and contextualise the competences and skills needed as they embark on their careers whilst simultaneously giving them experience of enterprise engagement.

A quasi-experimental design was employed with Pre (N = 55), Post-1 (N = 55), and Post-2 (N = 51) assessments to measure content knowledge and perceptions, using both quantitative and qualitative data. Mann-Whitney tests showed significant differences between Pre and both Post-1 (p = 0.0028) and Post-2 (p = 0.0044), but not between Post-1 and Post-2 (p = 0.5014). Content knowledge improved with both VR head-mounted displays and flat screen methods compared to traditional lectures. However, VR with head-mounted displays performed better than flat screen methods. The perception survey analysis used a two-sample test for proportions to compare the delivery modes. Post survey scores indicated that head-mounted VR had higher mean and median values compared to traditional and flat screen methods, suggesting it was perceived as more valuable, engaging, and effective in learning. Sentiment analysis of open-ended responses showed that students rated the flat screen delivery mode more positively in Post-2. Although head-mounted VR showed a similar trend, it didn’t achieve the same level of positivity. Enhancing the user interface and visual quality could improve its positive sentiment. The results highlight VR’s effectiveness as an educational tool, providing immersive, customizable learning environments and risk-free simulations that could transform sustainability education and equip future leaders for global challenges. © 2025 TEMPUS Publications.","engineering education; knowledge retention; perception; sustainability; virtual reality; VR","Engineering education; Flat panel displays; Helmet mounted displays; Students; Content knowledge; Cutting edges; Delivery modes; Educational platforms; Flat-screens; Head mounted virtual reality; Head-mounted-displays; Knowledge retention; Research gaps; Sustainability education; Virtual environments",Article,"",Scopus

Through a cross-case analysis, a hybrid theoretical-empirical model is developed to identify and analyse a broad range of possible and actual responses to sustainability within engineering education. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a multiple-case study design to compare the experiences of educators and students engaging with sustainability topics in two contrasting tertiary civil engineering programs. It draws on an original conceptual framework informed by the literature for analysing educational responses to sustainability around the world, which can be applied to a diverse range of educational settings. Conceptual review, fieldwork, case-specific and cross-case analysis have been used to refine the framework, enabling the emergence of a hybrid model. Findings: The hybrid model suggests three levels of response to sustainability in engineering education, which can be characterised as: 1) incorporation, 2) integration and 3) transformation. Each level is analysed in relation to five dimensions: functions, content, relationships, spaces and time, which influence the nature of the response and its capacity to foster learning. Cross-case analysis findings suggest that the shape and focus of a particular response to sustainability are significantly influenced by both the types of engineering problems, and the diversity and extent of relationships that engineering educators and students engage during teaching and learning. Practical implications: Cross-case analysis reveals that developing and supporting (inter)subjective relationships can play a pivotal role in fostering a transformation level of response. Engagement with Indigenous, more-than-human and interdisciplinary perspectives in engineering education for sustainability can also be critical to deepening students’ reflexivity. Originality/value: The study helps ground theory-driven frameworks for analysing the nature and purpose of responses to sustainability in engineering education, and higher education more broadly. The study also offers a novel hybrid model for identifying and classifying responses to sustainability in engineering education and other disciplines. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cross-case analysis; Engineering education; Environmental and sustainability education; Multiple-case design; Sustainability",,Article,"",Scopus

Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education isa growing educational approach that appears to share some common goals and pedagogies of EfS. The authors conducted a scoping literature review to examine the parallels between STEM education and EfS competencies in K-12 education. A total of 25 articles from 2013 to 2022 were reviewed, revealing emergent themes in the data. Many competencies fell under the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) key competencies for sustainability (UNESCO, Education for Sustainable Development Goals Learning Objectives, 2017). This review revealed that the most common competencies in both educational initiatives are systems thinking, critical thinking, and collaborative skills. The findings of this systematic review inform future research regarding how these emergent competencies can be used to enable EfS to become more mainstream in K-12 STEM education classrooms and initial teacher education (ITE) programs in higher education, which would transfer skills into STEM careers. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Competencies; Education for sustainability; STEM education; Sustainability education",,Book Chapter,"",Scopus

In this way, a model is proposed that integrates the three components of sustainability and the teaching task as antecedents of attitudes towards sustainable development, and its subsequent influence on the knowledge and behaviours of students towards sustainable development, from a problem-based learning (PBL) approach. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 626 engineering students from a university in the Dominican Republic were surveyed. This is a private university with the largest number of students and has a wide range of engineering careers. The questionnaire was applied on a 5-point Likert scale to students who had taken and passed a subject related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, the students had participated in activities related to the SDGs. The data were analysed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) methodology. Findings: The results of this research suggest the importance of sustainability education in engineering programs and highlight how students’ attitudes towards sustainability, influenced by a variety of factors, including perceived faculty commitment, can significantly affect their willingness to adopt sustainable practices. Originality/value: This research topic generates new results for higher education and sustainable development in the Dominican Republic. It is highlighted that the attitudes of engineering students towards sustainable development explain 54.31% of their sustainable knowledge. This is interesting, because other variables had previously been indicated as antecedents of sustainable knowledge, but attitudes specifically towards sustainable development had not generated such relevant values of importance for sustainable knowledge. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of attitudes towards teachers, rarely explored, as a determining key in the formation of sustainable attitudes, underlining educational interaction as an essential element in the promotion of sustainable development. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Engineering students’ attitudes; Higher education in the Dominican Republic; Problem-based learning (PBL); Sustainability knowledge and behaviours; Sustainable development in engineering",,Article,"",Scopus

Its educational choices highlight how integrated planning of the sectors water, energy and food and other relevant sectors can enable more efficient resource use, thus reducing GHG emissions—climate mitigation—and support climate adaptation in an integrated manner. Thus, the Nexus approach can enhance water, energy and food security integrally with social security. In its action- and solution-oriented transdisciplinary approach, the initiative targets resource-stressed regions. Nexus@TUM builds on an environmental engineering perspective to integrate social, governance and economic aspects.

As technology rapidly advances, engineers, who often begin their careers with an engineering technology background, are at the forefront of applying practical engineering principles and developing sustainable innovations. This paper proposes a multifaceted educational approach that integrates sustainability, systems thinking, and innovative teaching methods into the undergraduate engineering technology curriculum, thereby ensuring that graduates are adept at confronting the sophisticated sustainability challenges of the 21st century. The reform strategy is applied to our four-year Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology curriculum, and encompasses several key initiatives: embedding sustainability concepts into core engineering courses, crafting learning outcomes that promote systems thinking, utilizing innovative pedagogies based on ""Engineering for One Planet,"" expanding the curriculum with relevant examples, incorporating practical mini-projects, and embedding sustainability frameworks in capstone design projects. The approach also suggests the inclusion of biomimicry principles, the adoption of advanced Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools, the integration of energy process assessments, and the utilization of the business model canvas with a sustainability perspective in the curriculum. This holistic educational model aims to not only enrich the learning experience of students in engineering technology programs but also to arm them with the essential competencies and insights needed to tackle complex sustainability issues in their engineering careers.

Currently, civil engineering programs typically teach sustainability indirectly, generally as a theme accompanying more conventional disciplines or through select embedded lessons within traditional courses. Some universities employ upper-level electives, clubs, or even independent study experiences to teach sustainability principles to undergraduates. Many courses dedicated to sustainable development are limited to graduate programs. In this paper, we present the results of a faculty team's efforts to design a new course on sustainable infrastructure development as a part of undergraduate civil engineering curricula. We conduct benchmarking with existing programs that teach infrastructure and sustainable development as explicit courses within civil engineering. We crosswalk the pedagogical framework within the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Excellence in Civil Engineering Education (ExCEEd) Model to the draft syllabus and specific elements of the new course, to include a structured organization with appropriate learning objectives for each lesson, in-class activities, and proposed out-of-class assignments.

Deepening inequality worldwide, aggravated by climate injustices and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, has increased engineering scholars' awareness of the necessity of developing a new engineering pedagogy and corresponding ethical framework to prepare an engineering workforce that can perform successfully and efficiently in multicultural and globalized settings. The University of Connecticut (UConn) has pioneered in developing a curriculum that equips engineering students with core concepts and methodological tools necessary to analyze the role of engineering in society, using a Human Rights framework. This paper explores learning outcomes in an existing course within this curriculum (i.e., “Engineering for Human Rights”) by analyzing original exit survey data from enrolled students. Our survey instrument integrated New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) statements to assess variation in perceptions of the usefulness of the course content as it relates to sustainability.

With a mission dedicated to support students in an individualized learning experience, RHIT strives to be a global leader of engineering and science education. In line with its vision, the institution aims to produce graduates who are not only inspired and prepared for success but also equipped to address the complex challenges facing our global society. We have comprehensively explored RHIT's sustainability education, examining its initiatives, curriculum, and integration of sustainability principles across various disciplines. By delving into the sustainable practices and educational approaches employed by the institute, we can better understand how RHIT is cultivating a generation of engineers and scientists who possess the knowledge and skills needed to define and solve the multifaceted problems of our complex global society. This report does not look to guide RHIT in its campus sustainability indicated through resource consumption, waste management, or sustainability reports. However, sustainability education extends beyond what is present strictly in the curriculum through various co-curricular and extracurricular activities which may incite discussion of the sustainability culture present at RHIT as indicated by any campus sustainability commitments. By analyzing the current state of sustainability education at RHIT and its relevance in meeting the institution's strategic goals, we can pave the way for a brighter and more sustainable future. Upon review of the school's course catalog, courses were categorized as fitting into four tiers related to the level of sustainability coverage and the potential for incorporating sustainability content. Survey data was collected from current students and faculty to assess perceptions of sustainability coverage in courses. Finally, we reviewed sustainability-related degree programs and course offerings at peer institutions to assess how these institutions were addressing sustainability in education. Having examined the baseline of sustainability education at RHIT and reviewed the availability of sustainability education at other peer institutions, this assessment provides an initial understanding of the current opportunities at RHIT. To complement the value of this baseline assessment, common practices and comprehensive guides of integration of sustainability pillars and the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals in education are summarized to recognize other areas of potential. By acknowledging the existing efforts and identifying areas for improvement, further advancements in sustainability education are proposed that align with the local institutional strategic planning goals to enhance sustainability education at RHIT and can guide other institutions of higher education in their endeavors. Collective efforts and a commitment to continuous improvement can enable similar institutions to instill mindsets of sustainability in students to address sustainability-related global challenges utilizing RHIT as a case study. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.",,"Curricula; Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals; Teaching; Waste management; Waste utilization; 'current; Campus sustainability; Engineering and mathematics; Global society; High educations; Individualized learning; Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology; Sustainability coverages; Sustainability education; Undergraduate education; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

These efforts served to help institutionalize the ongoing sustainable engineering instruction at The Ohio State University in a meaningful way. Currently, engineering students at OSU do not have a formal pathway or structure to engage with sustainability-related, community-engaged content. While culturally competent sustainability focused coursework may be obtained piecemeal, it is certainly not universally accessible as a primary focus to engineering students with tight degree plan requirements within their majors. The proposed specialization is an important long-term programmatic creation effort to advance sustainability education within engineering. The department chair has supported a multi-year effort to support and create student-centric community-engaged learning opportunities. This department driven (top-down) effort is also supported at college level by the Associate Dean and Director for Academic Programs in the College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. The Engineering for One Planet Mini-Grant resources were to develop General Education course offerings within the Sustainability theme as well as technical electives that promote social responsibility. Course creation and revisions incorporated EOP learning outcomes; many of these revisions took effect in Autumn 2023. Additionally, one of the core courses of our proposed specialization will be offered on a satellite campus beginning Spring 2024. The EOP framework provided the guiding principles for the proposed specialization. These programmatic elements balance student learning with community impacts while weaving Sustainability, Intercultural Competence and Cultural Awareness into a core tenet of engineering. Further, the EOP mentorship program was instrumental in guiding the project participants in creating buy-in from stakeholders across the university enterprise. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.",,"Curricula; Sustainable development; Teaching; Biological engineering; Catalyse; Courseworks; Engineering instructions; Food engineering; Learning outcome; Ohio State University; Programmatics; Specialisation; Sustainable engineering; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

However, employer demand for green skills continues to outpace the supply. Furthermore, most engineering students are unable to access the educational experiences that will prepare them for sustainability-focused careers. Engineering for One Planet (EOP) is one of the initiatives working to address this gap by using a multi-pronged approach to support and accelerate the integration of social and environmental sustainability into engineering education. Supported by The Lemelson Foundation, EOP provides a framework of student learning outcomes, teaching guides, grant funding in collaboration with partners like ASEE, and support for the EOP Network (EOPN), an impact-driven network of diverse stakeholders committed to integrating environmental and social sustainability into engineering. EOP's efforts have proven successful in fueling hundreds of courses across disciplines to integrate sustainability. While the EOP initiative has intentionally engaged students through a number of avenues, faculty champions have been at the center of curricular change efforts. Thus, the approach has not yet tapped the full potential of student changemakers to advocate for and support curricular change. This paper draws upon primary research conducted during a workshop at the Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW) conference in 2023 to understand students' motivations and capacity to support curricular change efforts and students' innovative approaches and priorities for curricular change. The paper also integrates the autoethnographies of student participants of the Engineering for One Planet Network (EOPN). The ESW workshop findings underscore students' passion for climate action and sustainability and their desire to support curricular change. The autoethnographies of EOPN student participants provide a first-hand perspective of students' experiences, benefits, and challenges on their journey toward becoming changemakers. This paper advocates for the active involvement of students in curricular change and highlights the potentially powerful role of peer networks and student-led initiatives in promoting sustainability within engineering education. By leveraging student changemakers' enthusiasm and innovative thinking, we can collectively work toward a more sustainable future in engineering education and practice. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","Student Changemakers; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Sustainable Engineering","Climate change; Curricula; Engineering education; Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals; Teaching; Change efforts; Curricular changes; Educational experiences; Engineering program; Integrate sustainability; Social and environmental; Social sustainability; Student changemaker; Sustainable development goal; Sustainable engineering; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

It is a process by which all design variables that affect one another are considered together. In recent decades, the industry has increasingly demanded engineers be equipped with the skills to apply sustainability in building and construction projects. Universities are starting to emphasize sustainability concepts in various engineering programs. Because industry standards are becoming higher, students should learn in their courses to be aware of what constitutes green design and have some experience putting it into practice. As a critical approach to creating a green building, the integrated process plays a vital role in sustainability education. It guides students to implement green building design knowledge in real projects and eventually enhances their in-depth understanding of sustainability. This paper presents a semester-long project in an undergraduate-level course that required students to adopt the integrated design approach to design a house that will be used as an educational center for sustainability. The project was completed in multiple phases, from hosting a charrette for conceptual design to running an energy consumption test for the final detailed design. A standard sustainable design rubric evaluated students' designs, and their engagement and learning outcomes were also evaluated at the end of the course. The feedback shows that students were highly motivated to learn the integrated design process and sustainability from the project. This project will be a pilot study to develop an educational module on green building design for engineering educators. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","Green Buildings; Integrative Design; Sustainability","Architectural design; Conceptual design; Curricula; Ecodesign; Green development; Students; Sustainable building; Sustainable development; Built environment; Case-studies; Collaborative approach; Design variables; Design-process; Green building design; Green buildings; Integrated design process; Integrative design; Learn+; Green buildings",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

This research will focus on the application of these techniques to the energy industry - in particular, solar renewable energy generation in all the States in the United States (US). One strong opposing action against the progression of climate change is the use of renewable energy. The objective of the research is to develop a case study on renewable solar energy and its impact on abating or preventing CO2 emissions to help reduce the severe impacts of climate change in the United States and demonstrate how it supports the 3Es of sustainability at the same time. This research paper will specifically explore the past production of solar energy in all the states in the US, and with the use of data analysis tools will predict the production to the year 2030. The reduction of CO2 emissions with the use of renewable solar energy is in direct support of the three elements of sustainability, namely the 3Es: Environment, Economics, and Equity (or social justice). This research will quantify the past benefits already realized in all these three areas for solar energy, and project them up to 2030. Cluster analysis technique will be applied to solar generation across all US States to identify group(s) at distinct levels of production. This can help States to follow the leading State(s) policy and process to increase their solar generation and thus help manage climate change. Solar energy generation challenges and recycling issues of solar equipment will also be addressed. This case study approach will fill a gap that currently exists in engineering education when it comes to exploring renewable energy and its sustainability benefits with modern data analysis tools. This research will use publicly available data sources (e.g., NREL, EIA), ubiquitous Excel, and open-source data analytics and prediction tool Orange (for K-Means clustering analysis), so this type of case study approach could be taught and engage engineering students without any barrier.

In response to student interest and employer requests, an Introduction to Sustainable Engineering course has been developed in the Ralph E. Martin Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Arkansas. The class has been structured as a three credit-hour elective for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students. The course has been taught for two semesters, and it has been approved to count toward the university-level minor in Sustainability. As an introductory course, it exposes students to a broad range of topics in the field and prepares them for subsequent sustainability courses. An emphasis is placed on real-world applications across the three pillars of sustainability through interdisciplinary collaboration, industry speakers, and case studies. Key components of the course include foundational sustainability principles, corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting, decarbonization, sustainability in materials, life cycle assessment (LCA), renewable energy, and sustainable engineering design principles. In addition, students participate in three lab components-two experiments and one demonstration-exploring alternative energy sources including the production of H2 fuel, solar power, and polymer pyrolysis to fuel oil. Student learning is assessed through reflection papers at the end of each unit, two lab reports, and a group project at the end of the semester. A new course in LCA will be taught in the department in Spring 2024 to supplement the sustainability curriculum. The Introduction to Sustainable Engineering course was offered first in Spring 2022 and again in Fall 2023. At the beginning of the Fall 2023 course, a pre-assessment was administered to the students to establish a baseline of knowledge. At the conclusion of the semester, a post-assessment measured student growth in their understanding of sustainability concepts. Students completing the course should be able to explain the principles and concepts that underlie sustainability, including environmental, social, and economic aspects. Furthermore, the students should be able to develop sustainable solutions to real-world problems involving the chemical industry and chemical engineering applications.

The courses range from first-year to graduate-level. Lateral expansion of the framework extends to non-current engineering departments and vertically expands to the university's Sustainability Office. The impact of EOP/sustainability instruction will be measured and freely disseminate all developed materials and findings via multiple mechanisms, particularly a companion website. Researchers have shown that the delivery methods of teaching sustainability varied among their survey respondents and interviewees. The proposed delivery methods are to integrate concepts of sustainability into existing core and elective courses, but also to provide routes for students to focus on sustainability. This is accomplished via project-based learning with and without external advisors, instituting engineering degree emphases and programs in sustainability, and showcasing successes with the Sustainability Office and university faculty for future expansion. The EOP Initiative and Framework have already provided an excellent foundation to use for assessment. A matrix has been constructed to track the implementation of these outcomes in project courses. This matrix will also aid ABET accreditation efforts and incorporate global considerations via the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Making these connections will allow students to see the global significance of their education and decisions.

The game, developed by the Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Center and the World Bank, was designed to support learning and conversations about long-term investments under uncertainty by making participants more familiar with the process of planning for extremes and climate change impacts while minimizing risk. This work included three cohorts of students: two graduate level courses and one undergraduate level course. The students' self-reported quantitative and qualitative results were analyzed to determine the impact of the D4tD game in improving student understanding of and attitudes towards uncertainty and robust decision making for climate change adaptation and planning. Quantitative results implied that students found it difficult to make beneficial decisions as uncertainty increased. Students seemed to be more cautious when making collective decisions compared to individual decisions. This collective risk aversion highlighted the benefits of collective learning and decision making for risk management. From the qualitative results, common themes (such as “Informed Decision Making” and “Risk Preparedness”), common keywords (“flood”, “drought”, “climate”, “uncertainty”), and varying emotions observed in student responses indicated students' awareness of and growing understanding about uncertainty and robust decision making, and pointed to the social/psychological aspects of playing the D4tD game and making decisions under uncertainty. In conclusion, these results attest to the benefit of the D4tD game as a tool within this university and departmental context to improve student understanding of and attitudes towards uncertainty and robust decision making for climate change adaptation and risk management.

Educating engineering students in sustainable (bio-inspired) design helps them to understand the impacts of their decisions on the environment and natural resources and empowers them to make positive changes. On the other hand, entrepreneurship enables students to learn how to spot, evaluate, and explore opportunities, build a prototype, and test it to design a project that satisfies clients' needs and aesthetic preferences. Unfortunately, educational institutions and researchers lag, particularly when integrating an entrepreneurial mindset with green building. Thus, this study emerged to overcome this contemporary interdisciplinary challenge and prepare green entrepreneurs and T-shaped engineers. PURPOSE OR GOAL: This study aims to prepare future green entrepreneurs and T-shaped engineers by creating a curriculum that integrates entrepreneurship and STEAM with construction projects' sustainable (bio-inspired) design and assessing students' perceptions of this curriculum development. The guiding research question is: What are the assessment themes of students' perceptions of integrating entrepreneurship and STEAM with sustainability in a curriculum in which students design green (bio-inspired) roofs? These themes help to understand student voices and interpret the information they share at a deeper level toward continuous improvement to curriculum development. Subsequently, the researcher can gain more significant insights into educational effectiveness's who, what, and how. APPROACH OR METHODOLOGY/METHODS: This study was conducted at the Civil and Environmental Engineering and Construction Management Department at a University in the United States. The study was a four-week assignment integrated into two senior-level courses: 1. the capstone project course in two semesters, 2. the pre-construction management course in one semester. This study uses participatory action research (PAR) as a data collection instrument. PAR is a qualitative approach in which researchers work collaboratively with the participant subject population to collect data, reflect and take action. Photovoice, commonly linked to PAR, is used to collect and explore qualitative data, give a unique depth of understanding to the research questions identified, and offer new insights and perspectives toward making improvements. Data obtained are analyzed using thematic analysis, a fundamental qualitative method for finding patterns within the data set using a step-by-step process. ACTUAL OUTCOME: After analyzing the qualitative data, six core themes related to this study were identified, including (1) curriculum design, (2) students, (3) entrepreneurship, (4) sustainable (bio-inspired) design, (5) art, and (6) technology. Each one of these six themes includes subthemes. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY: This study fulfills a knowledge gap by researching a novel topic that contributes to advancing interdisciplinary learning experiences in engineering curricula. In addition to green roofs, this study can be applied to all other components of green buildings and replicated by instructors of other institutions. This study concludes with recommendations for improving the curriculum design and student performance. It also recommends further studies in engineering education and the AEC (Architecture/Engineering/Construction) industry using other research methods and investigating this study topic in depth. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.","Engineering Education; Entrepreneurship; Sustainability","Curricula; Ecodesign; Environmental management; Green development; Natural resources exploration; Research and development management; Roofs; Students; Sustainable development; Teaching; Bio-inspired designs; Curricula design; Curriculum development; Entrepreneurship; Green buildings; Participatory action research; Qualitative data; Research questions; Student perceptions; T-shaped engineers; Project management",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

The paper argues that unnecessary alienations between cultural-emblematic and mathematical-logical epistemes, especially those linked to narrow interpretations and restricted developments in dialogism and dialectics, respectively, are influenced by restricted understandings of epistemological, ontological, and praxiological philosophical drivers in meaning making and responsive action. In response, the paper develops a series of philosophical principles that, it argues, could usefully underpin STEAM education practices. These are a) iterations of epistemological expansion and contraction (in response to monologic meaning making), b) an expansive and deepening ontology (in response to ontological collapse in describing the world), c) critical and judgmental rationality (finding a middle ground between radical relativism and dogma), and d) concrete utopianism (in response to idealism and additive holisticism). The emergence of the four philosophical principles is developed through illustrative examples of a broad range of arts (fine art, performance art, photography, film, poetry, prose, and music). © 2024 Ingrid Schudel.","dialectical critical realism; dialogism; education for sustainable development; STEAM education; transformative pedagogies",,Article,"",Scopus

The hackathon focused on four United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—Quality Education, Affordable and Clean Energy, Sustainable Cities and Communities, and Climate Action. Using VR technology and game design software, engineering students worked in teams. They competed against each other in designing immersive environments that demonstrated their understanding of these SDGs and climate change. Our goal was to encourage the development of empathy, education, and awareness around these critical global issues. The hackathon also integrated authentic assessments, mirroring real-world engineering tasks and providing a more practical and relevant learning experience. Our findings suggest that this VR hackathon has significantly enhanced students’ understanding of the SDGs and climate change issues, their competency with VR technologies, as well as their teamwork and problem-solving skills. This paper discusses the hackathon’s design, implementation, and outcomes, highlighting the potential of such innovative approaches in tackling climate change education and awareness. © 2024 by the authors.","climate change; education; renewable energy; sustainable development; virtual reality","alternative energy; climate change; education; learning; sustainable development; United Nations; virtual reality",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Ireland's national Deposit Return Scheme (DRS) exemplifies the consequences of excluding inclusive design, as return machines are primarily designed for standing users, making them inaccessible to wheelchair users. Additionally, cramped spaces and narrow aisles can further hinder manoeuvrability, underscoring the need for inclusive design principles to ensure equal participation in recycling efforts. This paper focuses on the development of a Socio-Environmental Framework that integrates transversal competencies to foster sustainable and inclusive designs in engineering education. Transversal competencies, encompassing skills, values, and attitudes essential for comprehensive development and adaptability, are vital for advancing inclusive design. These competencies, which include communication, empathy, lifelong learning, and teamwork, are supported by frameworks such as LifeComp and GreenComp developed by the EU. LifeComp focuses on personal, social, and learning-to-learn competencies, while GreenComp emphasizes sustainability competencies. By evaluating a professional development module for Level 7 engineering students, this study assesses the curriculum's effectiveness in preparing future engineers to create inclusive and sustainable solutions. Emphasizing empathy, critical thinking, and adaptability, the framework guides engineers to meet societal, ethical, and environmental responsibilities. © 2024 SEFI 2024 - 52nd Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering, Proceedings: Educating Responsible Engineers.

With the aim of preparing future engineers, undergraduate engineering education is shifting environmental sustainability from the outskirts of the student experience to the center of curricular structures. For example, student engagements with environmental sustainability, referred to as 'sustainability' in this paper, are moving from co-curricular experiences (e.g., Grand Challenges Scholars Program) to required coursework. Efforts to identify and inculcate sustainability-related knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as behaviors, beliefs, and mindsets needed by engineering graduates are advancing. This transformation, while critical, can be challenging for institutions, instructors, and students alike, and results from early implementers of sustainability-related curricular experiences can inform these efforts. We present an intervention integrating ecological system design practices. Our innovative practice lies in pursuing holistic treatment of environmental sustainability in a core required introductory course enlivening disciplinary practices with student-centered pedagogy. For the purposes of preliminary assessment of this intervention, we reviewed students' engagement with sustainability during the course, their post-experience sustainability beliefs and attitudes, and the course assistants' narratives about their engagement with the students focused on sustainability. Preliminary results indicate a limited affinity for autonomous engagement with sustainability practices. Potential emerging explanations include differing perspectives between students and instructors on what constitutes impactful sustainability practice, a lack of a supporting context for establishing personal beliefs, and a lack of support for developing course-related ideas of the self and sustainability. Our experience has implications for early STEM curricula involving environmental sustainability. Requiring sustainability knowledge, skills, and abilities development ensures all students experience certain practices, but does not ensure their adoption into professional identities. We propose highlighting the course's hidden curriculum and focusing on the social architecture, establishing a more explicit community-of-practice container to enable more authentic sustainability participation. © 2024 IEEE.","first-year design curriculum; identity-based education; knowledge-skills-abilities; sustainability education","Curricula; Ecodesign; Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals; Teaching; Design curricula; Environmental sustainability; First year design; First-year design curriculum; Identity-based; Identity-based education; Innovative practices; Knowledge-skill-ability; Sustainability education; Sustainability practices; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

In addition to knowledge about sustainability, engineering students require skills for effectively integrating these concepts into their work to both perceive opportunities and to convince others to adopt more sustainable approaches. It is these skills that are the focus of this workshop. Participants will experience an interactive activity with tangibles, designed for engineering students, that targets the development of 3 transversal skills relevant to sustainability: systems thinking, perspective taking and negotiation. This activity employs a three-facet framework for teaching transversal skills: knowing (strategies and models to implement the skill), experiencing (opportunities to apply the skills and encounter relevant difficulties) and learning by experience (meta-cognitive/emotional reflection to promote transfer). Workshop activities provide structured opportunities to consider how to create learning experiences that embody the evidence-informed criteria of providing relevant information on implementing the targeted skills, supporting low-stakes experimentation, delivering timely feedback and encouraging transfer into future contexts. This workshop provides engineering educators with both a specific activity (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10731771) and a general framework (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13328581) for designing activities to teach transversal skills.

This initiative utilizes constructivist, experiential, and immersive learning theories to create engaging, practical learning experiences for high school and undergraduate students, specifically tailored to the unique challenges of Puerto Rico-a region frequently subjected to extreme natural events and exposed to multihazard risk. The primary objective of this educational initiative is to address the severe shortage of professionals capable of managing and aiding recovery from natural disasters in coastal and neighboring regions. Through educational modules hosted on the Interactive Learning Hub (IL-HUB), the program aims to attract talented STEM and other disciplines students, cultivate a skilled workforce, enhance infrastructure resilience, foster innovative problem-solving skills, and bridge the gap in professional expertise necessary for effective disaster response and recovery. The initiative is particularly relevant given Puerto Rico's vulnerability to hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural hazards. By leveraging real-world scenarios and hands-on activities, students gain a deep understanding of resilient coastal infrastructure (RCI) and disaster management practices. A mixed-method, performance-focused survey approach was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of this initiative, involving quantitative pre- and post-module assessments complemented by qualitative feedback from participants. Survey responses indicate that 85% of participants rated the lectures and activities positively, expressing satisfaction with the quality of the presentations, organization, and clarity of expression. Additionally, 85.7% of students reported a heightened curiosity or commitment to pursuing further studies or careers in resilience-related fields, highlighting the significant impact of the program on student engagement and interest in RCI. These results demonstrate a significant level of student engagement and understanding of RCI suggesting that these modules substantially promote learning and resilience planning while encouraging students to consider these areas as a professional career path. The paper outlines specific educational outcomes, including enhanced student interest in RCI careers and better preparation for addressing coastal challenges. By detailing these methods and results, the paper aims to provide a replicable model for educators seeking to integrate similar frameworks into their curriculum. This approach contributes valuable insights into the practice of engineering and resilience education in disaster-prone areas, ultimately supporting the development of a new generation of professionals equipped to handle the complexities of coastal resilience and disaster management. © 2024 IEEE.","disaster management; experiential learning; resilient infrastructure; workforce development","Crushed stone plants; Curricula; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Earthquakes; Emotional intelligence; Empowerment of personnel; Engineering education; Engineering research; Ergonomics; Hazards; Risk management; Shore protection; Teaching; Coastal infrastructure; Disaster management; Experiential learning; High school students; Puerto Rico; Resilient infrastructure; Student engagement; Students' interests; Undergraduate students; Workforce development; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

This study designed three educational board games representing common structures among global anthropogenic issues and investigated their effects on the lessons learned by university students. Experts in Energy System Engineering, Virology, Philosophy of Education, Design Science, Agricultural Economics, and Law participated in this study. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th authors of this study designed games named ‘Parasite Wars’, ‘The Dialogue with Future’, and ‘The House”. The concept of games, such as themes, roles and purposes of players, and lessons expected to be imparted to participants, largely differed among the games; each designer represented the same issues from very different perspectives. The results of test sessions with 60 students suggest that participants learned lessons relevant to the messages that the designers conveyed. Further, discussions and reviews for designing board games are useful to understand the perspectives and approaches of experts in other fields and reflect on the roles of their own disciplines in terms of sustainability education. Such interdisciplinary collaboration enables the design of educational content that complements diverse perspectives on global anthropogenic issues and has the potential to help promote a holistic view of such complex issues. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Anthropocene; Game-based Learning; Interdisciplinary Collaboration","Agriculture; Engineering education; Students; Anthropocene; Anthropogenics; Board games; Common structures; Education designs; Energy systems engineerings; Game-based Learning; Holistic view; Interdisciplinary collaborations; University students; Economics",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

However, the concept’s elusive and complex nature requires careful consideration in order to lead to impactful learning. This study provides a comprehensive overview of engineering institutions’ practical efforts to foster global competence learning. Guided by a systematic literature review covering the last two decades, it provides a comprehensive account of work related to the concept. The study first explores institutions’ practical efforts to promote global competence development, highlighting the most popular institutional approaches, including intercultural collaborations, mobility experiences, internationalization at home activities, and virtual collaborations. Furthermore, it critically analyzes how the concept is translated into practice, showing that practical efforts often lack guiding conceptualizations or reliable outcome assessments. To provide a thorough overview of institutional engagement with global competence, the study also highlights the geographical contexts of the universities involved in such efforts, as well as related chronological trends and developments, before concluding with reflections on the future of global competence education. © 2024 The Author(s).

The framework can be used for self-assessment and the review of curricula. However, a step-by-step method to conduct such a self-assessment is not yet available for the GreenComp framework specifically. Therefore, the authors present the GreenComp Evaluation Roadmap allowing to evaluate the extent to which the frameworks’ competences for sustainability are integrated in higher-education curricula. The application of the GreenComp Evaluation Roadmap to a curriculum taught at the University of Aruba, allows to report on the benefits, limitations and future potential of the approach. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed mixed-method approach combines hybrid qualitative and quantitative data collection on the integration of the 12 competences for sustainability of the GreenComp framework in higher-education curricula. The authors showcase its potential through application of the GreenComp framework as an evaluation tool to a science, technology, engineering and mathematics-based bachelor program taught at the University of Aruba. Findings: The GreenComp Evaluation Roadmap not only allows for an evaluation of the curriculum and identification of competence gaps. It also supports educators to conduct a self-reflection on individual course(s) and the program as a whole. The paper shows promising results that the roadmap developed could be a reproducible approach. Moreover, it provides guidance to other higher education institutes for self-evaluation and self-reflection on how the competences for sustainability are integrated in their curricula and how this can be enhanced in the future.

As facilitators can adapt to these changes, they will be able to improve learning experiences for students. In this work, learning experiences about climate change were evaluated in undergraduate students without engineering background, as function of the size of the group, duration of the course, gamification activities and technology and virtual tools experiences. The implementation of these activities in the intensive 5-week course focused on climate change education has revealed valuable insights into student motivation, attitude, knowledge acquisition, and engagement. Notably, students’ trust in information sources about climate change exhibited variations, with global organizations garnering higher confidence compared to local and personal sources. In a 15-week course exposed to virtual tools (e.g. escape room), the diagnostic test highlighted a 53% understanding level, particularly challenging in numeric aspects. However, the escape room significantly improved results in the final exam, demonstrating a 93% correctness rate, emphasizing the effectiveness of the activities in reinforcing key climate change concepts. On the other hand, the emergence of climate change-themed escape room as an engagement tool demonstrated its potential in enhancing knowledge acquisition and cooperative learning. In addition, Escape room offered an immersive environment that encourages active participation, enabling students to grasp complex climate concepts and solutions more effectively. The study underscores that climate education should go beyond facts, emphasizing universities’ crucial role in nurturing the “climate change generation” with the knowledge and motivation for meaningful contributions to climate action and policy formulation.

The training is designed to promote knowledge and skills of both, students and professionals, in the context of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards. The paper’s purpose is to evaluate the suitability of the chosen environment of a learning factory (LF). Design/methodology/approach: The proposed content and approach were initially created as basic training for cooperation partners from industry and auditing by applying Bloom’s taxonomy up to the level of analyzing, evaluating and creating in a close-to-reality industrial environment. Subsequently, the training was adapted for higher engineering education. Three consecutive exercises are explained concerning the crucial stages of carbon footprinting. To provide support for the authors’ suggestion that LFs are effective for the training in the field of GHG accounting, pre- and post-test and questionnaires were applied. Findings: This case study reveals that LFs facilitate training participants to reliably identify, classify and quantify emission sources because of their authentic characteristics. Findings in this paper indicate that engineering students prefer this education practice over other formats. Practical implications: This case study on active learning may prompt other universities to introduce similar concepts and content. Also, industrial professionals can benefit from this application-oriented teaching method.

Education for Sustainability is assumed to offer a holistic approach to equip students with the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes needed to contribute to a more sustainable society in their future careers. While Case-Based Education traditionally focuses on disciplinary learning in simulated settings, it can also effectively teach essential sustainability-related skills like integrated problem-solving, critical thinking, and systems thinking. The approach we propose is “case hacking”, which should be understood as utilizing existing business cases while incorporating supplementary resources to align the assignment with intended learning objectives. This expansion of the cases involves, among other things, introducing additional questions and assignments, perspectives from stakeholders previously unexplored in the original case, and the integration of recent research articles from relevant fields. We advocate for the use of case hacking when educators want to harness the educational benefits of Case-Based Education while emphasizing the complexity of sustainability-related challenges faced by industrial companies today. As an illustrative example, we demonstrate the process of hacking a case related to Green Chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, highlighting specific challenges for chemistry and chemical engineering education. We hope this example will inspire educators in these disciplinary contexts to engage with the case hacking approach as they navigate the complex terrain of sustainability. © 2023","Case studies; Case-based education; CBE; Chemical engineering education; Education for sustainable development; ESD; Sustainable development",,Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Given the omnipresent nature of technology and its influence on our lives, engineers must consider the ethical, environmental and sociological impacts of their work, and some engineering programs are considering new pedagogical methods and broader frameworks to engage students in macroethics, sociotechnical thinking and engineering for social justice. Using a particular perspective on sociotechnical thinking (STSE), the goal of this research was to explore sociotechnical thinking within engineering instructor teaching goals and practices. The study also sought to identify the challenges and enabling factors that engineering instructors experience in utilizing teaching practices related to sociotechnical thinking. STSE was selected given both its inherent flexibility, and its specific features that allow for some natural connections with engineering. Using STSE also allowed for the introduction of a framework from a different context to assess its utility and relevance to the engineering landscape. This study employed an online survey, featuring both qualitative and quantitative methods, with engineering instructors at four universities in Canada, designed to provide an initial understanding and broad overview of STSE in the context of engineering education. Following the survey, a smaller group of instructors participated in semi-structured interviews, to provide a deeper understanding of instructor goals and practices related to STSE. The data offers a description of what STSE looks like in the context of undergraduate engineering education at four Canadian institutions, and bridges research and educational theory between both K-12 and Post-Secondary Education, and Science and Engineering Education. This work demonstrated that engineering instructors employ a diversity of goals and practices in their teaching, but demonstrate a strong bend towards real-world applications through a variety of mechanisms. Instructors demonstrated moderate support for STSE, with a strong orientation towards problem solving and design, but shared concerns, in particular about exploring issues of social justice and fairness and the possibility of imposing bias on students. This is reflective of work in engineering education that highlights the apolitical nature of engineering and its resonance in undergraduate engineering programs. Finally, a reframing of STSE is offered to acknowledge the role of problem solving rather than issue exploration in engineering, while highlighting the need to further consider the context of engineering activities, aligned with recent work on sociotechnical thinking and social responsibility in engineering. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Bridges; Climate change; Engineering research; Environmental technology; Population statistics; Social aspects; Students; Engineering instructors; Global society; Population growth; Problem-solving; Rapid urbanizations; Social concerns; Social engagement; Social justice; Sociotechnical; Undergraduate engineering students; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

To teach students about climate change and an emerging industry in carbon dioxide removal (CDR), a carbon dioxide capture experiment was included in a senior chemical engineering laboratory course. The experiment was iteratively scaled-up and student-designed in one rotation of a single-semester course. This paper includes experimental designs and associated data and outcomes from different iterations of the carbon dioxide capture module. The prototypes and experiments were designed and made by successive laboratory groups, with initial groups starting from small-scale chemistry experiments and subsequent groups progressively scaling up to a carbon dioxide absorption column. By the end of the semester, students had constructed a benchtop direct air capture (DAC) absorption column, using KOH to remove carbon dioxide from air. In addition to teaching important context, this curriculum modification also aimed to have students apply the fundamentals of reactor design and to have students collaborate with their peers to scale up chemical processes and create a final, usable product for future courses. Assignments were created to encourage student collaboration, creativity, hands-on design, and construction. The curriculum modification was evaluated by means of quantitative and qualitative survey, assessing aspects like the value of a student-led design module, of a climate change-relevant experiment, and of communicating with other groups to scale up a chemical process. A secondary outcome of this pedagogical experiment is a cheap and simple design of a chemical engineering laboratory experiment that can be easily replicated. This work demonstrates the value of supplementing traditional experiments with inquiry-based learning (IBL) and of including climate change content into the primary chemical engineering curriculum. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Chemical modification; Climate change; Curricula; Design of experiments; Engineering education; Potassium hydroxide; Product design; Research laboratories; Teaching; Absorption columns; Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon dioxide removal; Chemical process; Climate change impact; Engineering laboratories; Laboratory course; Potential technologies; Scale-up; Scaled-up; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

The students apply their cumulative knowledge gathered over the other technical courses taken during the study. While the capstone projects are designed to check the students' overall scientific understanding of the subject matter, often the sustainability component of the project is overlooked. Every day, large scale projects are being implemented to construct and repair US infrastructures where the environment friendly and long-lasting materials inclusion is increasing. In addition, civil engineers can contribute to cut down carbon emission using new and sustainable methods of construction. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has also put emphasis on the sustainable future without degrading the quality and availability of natural resources. To keep it mind, the sustainability component was included in the Capstone Project during Spring 2021 and Spring 2022 semester. The purpose of the current study is to document the sustainability element of the capstone project. In the Spring 2021 semester, students determined the carbon footprint of an exit ramp built on a major highway. The team calculated the amount of carbon-dioxide (CO2) generated from the construction and the savings from cutting down the commute time related emission. In the end, the number of years were reported to reach the breakeven point. In the Spring 2022, the capstone team determined the feasibility of different alternative materials i.e. recycled asphalt pavement for road construction and compared the Green House Gas (GHG) emissions from various alternatives. It was found that, the usage of recycled materials would considerably lower the GHG emissions compared to concrete road construction. Outcome of this study will assist the instructors to design their capstone class including the sustainability section. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Recycling; Road construction; Roads and streets; Sustainable development; Capstone design; Capstone projects; Engineering disciplines; Environment friendly; Greenhouse gas emissions; Large-scale projects; Senior design; Subject matters; Technical course; Undergraduate engineering; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

The impact of these technologies on a future hydrogen economy, the impact on smart grids, and job creation are also introduced. The curriculum draws heavily on the experience and background, both theoretical and field experience, of the instructors including NSF and DOE grants that allowed the design and implementation of a certified hydrogen development laboratory, and development of instructional materials for PEM training. The curriculum integrates key topics such as MATLABR and SIMULINKR modeling and simulation of critical components including PEM Fuel Cells, PV with storage and grid integration. Aside from lectures, the course relies heavily on project-based learning. The students are divided into teams to propose, design, and implement realistic, hands-on projects. When there is an opportunity for a large-scale project such as Project 1 discussed in this paper, the entire class participates with sub-disciplines organized around a specialty such as structural design or electrical interconnect of solar energy with the local utility. Safety and NEC (National Electrical Code) compliance are also discussed to satisfy course objectives. In summary, the class project is managed to mirror real world project implementation treating the class as design-build entity and sub-groups as sub-contractors.

Global warming is having irreversible damage to the world. “Carbon Emission Reduction” has become one of the most important goals of the entire world. It is the major issue discussed at the recent G20 Summit 2021 in Rome [1]. Each nation promised a specific goal of carbon emission reduction. To reach those promised goals, besides replacing fossil energy with green energy such as solar, wind, water, or nuclear, the design of those green energy power plants and the design of green energy using machines, buildings, vehicles, and other energy-consuming equipment become critical in reaching those goals. Green energy education is becoming important for the current and future engineers who will be responsible for those designs. The design mindset of engineers will have a great impact on society because of their direct or indirect responsibility in designing buildings, machines, vehicles, infrastructures, power plants, petroleum refinery processes, etc. The finished design would have long-lasting impact to the environment. Whether the engineers have “go green” in their minds could affect the overall environment of this world, and it will determine if the nation can reach its emission reduction goal. To help the engineering students to develop the “go green” mindset and put this term into action, one direct method is to put this “green” requirement into engineering students' design classes and make it a required element in their design projects. An overall “green” requirement was applied the junior design class. At out institution, students are required to find the best “green” choice for their specific design projects. A survey was done at the end of the semester to check the change in students' energy usage design mindsets. The survey results show that only 62% of the students thought about using green energy in their design before this class; 95% of the students would like to use green energy in their design after this class because of the green energy requirements. Among these 95%, 100% of those who worked on projects directly related to green energy decide to use green energy whenever possible in their future design. On the other hand, 82.5% of those students whose projects were not directly related to green energy application will also consider using green energy in their future designs. The results clearly show that the “go green” requirements in their design class greatly influenced their energy usage decision in their design. It demonstrates the importance of the “go green” requirement in engineering education. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.","Design Mindset; Design Projects; Green Requirement; Sustainability","Architectural design; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Curricula; Emission control; Energy utilization; Engineering education; Engineers; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Global warming; Life cycle; Students; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Design mindset; Design programs; Energy usage; Future designs; Green energy; Green requirement; Industrial development; Student design projects; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Many labs have difficulty implementing undergraduate research (UGR) programs despite the benefits. To address common challenges many institutions face with undergraduate research, we are developing a framework that emphasizes curiosity, connection, and value creation in research activities to foster an entrepreneurial mindset (EM) in undergraduate research. Using this framework, we aim to make research training more efficient, increase overall lab productivity, boost undergraduate research effectiveness, and motivate students. Our project goals are to expose undergraduate students to research opportunities early, teach students about resilience skills so they can persist and be successful in their work, and support faculty in developing and providing meaningful research opportunities for undergraduate students. As part of this work, we also aim to better understand undergraduate students' motivations for being involved in research. To foster EM and achieve these goals, we designed a series of videos and faculty-led EM training workshops for students. These activities are scalable and transferable for undergraduate researchers and their mentors at different institutions. The intent of these workshops is to enable students to become involved in research, and once involved, allow them to apply EM concepts to their research projects directly. Workshop topics include framing research questions with EM, building resilience in research, thriving in a research environment, developing a research pitch, using EM to drive effective data presentation, and focusing next steps in research to maximize research impact. Each workshop includes video content, a workbook, and a moderator guide, with workshops designed to be deployed either in-person or virtually facilitated by a workshop moderator. In designing our interventions, we considered alignment with guidelines provided by the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR), which include curating engaging and high-impact opportunities, creating a community of student scholars, peer mentoring, opportunities for early and sustained involvement, and program assessment [1]. To assess the impact of our workshop-based interventions on student research productivity and attitudes toward research, we developed a retrospective, post-experience survey and a one-year follow-up survey for students participating in the workshops. We initially distributed our post-experience survey to a baseline cohort of students who participated in UGR but did not complete the EM-focused workshops. To improve workshop content and better understand student motivations, we will collect the corresponding data from workshop participants in the future. This paper describes our project goals, planned workshop content, and baseline survey results available on undergraduate student attitudes and motivations related to participating in research. Eventually, by piloting workshops and collecting data collaboratively across five institutions that vary in size and culture, this project will deliver a flexible set of training modules and a menu of intervention options that other institutions may choose to modify and implement to improve undergraduate research experiences and outcomes. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Digital storage; Engineering education; Moderators; Motivation; Engagement in learning; Project goals; Research labs; Research opportunities; Student engagement; Student motivation; Training material; Undergraduate research; Undergraduate research programs; Undergraduate students; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

The course selected for this PBL - EML implementation is Applied Fluid Mechanics, a four-credit course with a lab component. It is the second in the fluid mechanics sequence and covers topics like pipeline systems, pump selection, and flow of air in ducts. During the spring and fall 2022 terms, the authors studied the role of the previously introduced PBL & EML exercises covering the fluid flow through pipeline systems and the flow of air in ducts. For example, one exercise asked the students to design a pump storage hydropower system able to satisfy a list of specific design requirements, including selecting a feasible pump and estimating the costs associated with implementing the proposed design. Another exercise asked the students to design an HVAC system able to provide heating/cooling for the two MET laboratories. In all instances, the students were asked to analyze the economical and societal impact of their designs based on the selection of three materials for their pipeline systems. Students were also asked to complete pre- and post-assignment surveys related to their EML. They also peer-reviewed components of all submitted projects except their own.

Systems thinking provides concepts and tools to understand complex problems that link society, economy, and the environment at multiple scales. The NRT Integrated FEW Systems course is a cross-listed course. Faculty from the College of Engineering, the College of Agriculture, and the College of Arts and Sciences have co-taught this class annually in the fall since 2019. This course is an introduction to systems thinking, with specific application to the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus. The course explores two basic types of systems and their interactions: natural-environmental systems and human-social systems. The course emphasizes the importance of systems thinking in developing effective policy to enhance resilience in FEW systems. This paper will discuss course format, content team teaching strategies, grading structures, evaluation, and lesson learned from teaching the course four years. The course lectures combine theory and practice, and design to establish knowledge base in system thinking concepts and tools, and focus on the unique challenges for management, governance, communication, and policy in the FEW nexus. Course grading includes reflections and analyses, creating system component maps with Loopy (a free online tool for thinking in systems), and a final project, an integrated system map. All assignments are individual assignments. The NRT external evaluator designed an annual NRT survey that assesses the NRT program at our university, including the impacts of the NRT Integrated FEW Systems course. Student ratings about their perceived ability to perform interdisciplinary systems tasks improved from the beginning to the end of the course, from 'somewhat able' to 'very able.' Students rated most course activities as “very useful”. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Climate change; Curricula; Engineering education; Grading; Integrated control; Knowledge based systems; Online systems; Students; Teaching; 'current; Complex problems; Energy; Global challenges; Graduate course; Graduate-level; Integrated systems; Sustainable communities; System thinkings; Water system; Systems thinking",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

While fossil energy will be used up in the future, converting solar energy to electric energy provides one potential solution to sustain the growth of the world population. The batteries play an essential role in electric energy storage, especially for electric vehicles (e.g., Tesla EV). The switch from traditional energy resources to renewable energy brings challenges and opportunities to chemical engineers who generally work in the oil & gas industry. To make students aware of these challenges and opportunities, a project was developed in the course of Chemical Process Control, which is the last required course taken by senior students in Chemical and Biological Engineering, to develop the mindset of Engineering for One Planet (EOP) in students. In this project, lectures were given to students on the nine core values of EOP, including Systems Thinking, Environmental Literacy, Social Responsibility, Responsible Business and Economy, Environmental Impact Measurement, Materials Choice, Design Mindsets, Critical Thinking, and Communication and Teamwork. After students were given the training materials on EOP Framework after the midterm, including handouts, videos and one lecture on the core concepts of EOP, three students formed a team to provide a two-page proposal on the scope of the project and the alignment of the proposed project with the nine core values of EOP. On the basis of the instructor's feedback, each team started to work on the project and submitted a report summarizing the obtained results by the end of the semester. An anonymous survey was given in class to collect students' feedback through multiple-choice questions on “how the EOP project helps students in learning process control” and “the effectiveness of the project in building the EOP mindset for students”. Personal conversations between the instructor and students were conducted to collect information on “the advantages and drawbacks of the EOP project” were also included in the survey. Both the instructor's evaluation and students' self-evaluation indicated that students generally learned and applied the EOP mindsets in their EOP projects. However, they were reluctant to recommend the EOP projects to other students, as students needed to learn EOP techniques like environmental sustainability and life cycle analysis that are not directly related to the focus of Chemical Process Control. Additional instruction videos/materials on EOP may be helpful. In addition, there should be multiple courses in the curriculum to introduce EOP mindset. It is challenging to convince students to learn and use EOP skills just in one course. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Curricula; Engineering education; Environmental impact; Feedback; Gas industry; Life cycle; Population statistics; Process control; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Systems thinking; Chemical process control; Core values; Design control; Electric energies; Environmental economics; Fossil energy; Learn+; Oil/gas industry; Renewable energies; World population; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Civil engineers play a vital role in this process by contributing their expertise to develop sustainable building solutions that enhance the built environment. The primary goal of the Engineering for One Planet (EOP) Framework is to provide engineers with the necessary skills and knowledge to safeguard the planet and its ecosystems, ensuring their sustainability for the benefit of all living beings. This project focused on introducing students in the Civil Engineering Technology five-year Bachelor of Science Program at Rochester Institute of Technology to sustainability concepts using the EOP framework. Curricular changes were implemented for two courses in the Civil Engineering Technology Program, a first-year introduction to civil engineering course reaching 72 students and a fourth-year structural steel design course reaching 30 students. The course materials introduced students to sustainability concepts for building and infrastructure projects. The students engaged in educational activities that offered them opportunities to enhance their comprehension of the course content and internalize sustainability principles at a deeper level. At the end of the semester, more than 80% of the students reported an improvement in their understanding of sustainability-related concepts and over 90% of the students said they had a better understanding of how civil engineers can contribute to a sustainable world according to the survey results. Using the two courses as pilot studies, this project aims to integrate sustainability concepts into other technical courses to equip students with a strong foundation and the necessary skills to become agents of change in promoting sustainability within the civil engineering and construction industry. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.","civil engineering; curriculum; sustainability","Building materials; Construction industry; Engineering education; Engineers; Intelligent buildings; Students; Sustainable development; Bachelor of science; Built environment; Civil engineering technology; Civil engineering technology programs; Curricular changes; Infrastructure project; Infrastructure systems; Rochester institute of technologies; Science projects; Sustainable building; Curricula",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

The course replaced a traditional pedagogical format that used lecture-discussion augment with extended homework assignments and a semester-long design project, which focused on the content of designing a wastewater treatment plants. The redesigned course uses the engineering design process to improve the local food system, which includes aspects of sustainability and life cycle principles of water, carbon, and nutrients.

Sustainable engineering requires improved design of products, systems, and services, targeting better environmental and social performance together with economic viability. The challenge is to reduce this powerful abstract concept into a rigorous educational framework, with clear-cut methods, tools, and metrics, so it can be integrated into engineering curricula and practiced by professionals. The United Nations defines sustainability in terms of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This requires a mutually optimal usage of natural, societal, and economic resources. Sustainability education necessitates the use of unconventional approaches as against the traditional lecture-based style. Some institutions have tried to develop a sustainability curriculum using the learning pedagogies of problem-based and project-based learning (PPBL). Using PPBL as a teaching and learning strategy facilitates cooperative learning, critical thinking, systemic reasoning, creative approach, and societal awareness, which are the core values of sustainability. However, translating this into a working curriculum is quite complex, and raises implementation issues such as physical arrangements for an active learning environment, changes in the assessment and grading system, providing both teachers and students with at least rudimentary knowledge of PPBL methods, achieving institutional support, etc. Another issue is the program-level decision of having a full dedicated course on sustainable engineering, or introducing modules on environmental engineering, green engineering, pollution prevention, waste minimization, and design for environment within a few relevant courses. The first part of this paper introduces the issues of sustainable development and sustainable engineering; the overlap of the terms sustainable, renewable, and recyclable; education for sustainable development; and pedagogy for sustainability education. The second part describes the ongoing implementation of sustainability content in the Mechanical Engineering program at our university, giving a roadmap for sustainability curriculum, and giving examples from the Product Design and the Engineering Materials courses.

Although economic and environmental sustainability is widely implemented, social sustainability or social equity is yet to gain traction. As globalization increases, engineering professionals and stakeholders must prioritize and incorporate social equity for the construction of sustainable developments, particularly infrastructure systems as they are the critical component of a functioning community. However, civil engineering and construction (CEC) education hardly focuses on disseminating knowledge about social equity, particularly equity in infrastructure systems thus hindering the path of creating equitable and sustainable future developments. Therefore, it is critical to introduce and educate future engineering professionals about infrastructure inequity issues as well as train them to ensure equity for both new and existing infrastructure systems through effective techniques. This research investigates the existing awareness of infrastructure inequity issues among CEC students and proposes effective solutions to improve such knowledge and awareness as well as equip them with techniques to address the issue by leveraging Envision sustainability rating system. To achieve this objective, the study implemented a training/workshop in a cross-listed sustainability course about various critical concepts of infrastructure inequity as well as how to address this issue through utilizing the Envision rating system. At first, the study conducted a pre-survey to record pre-established knowledge of the participants about social inequity and the importance of equitable infrastructure systems. Then, during the training, the students were introduced to important topics that include social inequity, gentrification, infrastructure inequity, equitable access to infrastructure, sustainable infrastructure rating system, and various credits of Envision rating system that support equitable infrastructure. The study conducted a post-survey of the participants following the training. The pre and post-survey responses were analyzed using the McNemar test. The results indicated that guided training helped the students to understand infrastructure inequity concerns and can potentially nurture their knowledge to address and mitigate such issues through implementing the Envision rating system. Furthermore, the boxplots demonstrating the self-assessment of the students highlighted that the training was effective to improve awareness among the students regarding the necessity of equitable infrastructure systems. The findings of the study would be valuable for increasing awareness of infrastructure inequity and facilitating the future construction workforce with the required knowledge to ensure an equitable infrastructure system. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Critical infrastructures; Economic and social effects; Engineering education; Knowledge management; Sustainable development; Economic sustainability; Engineering professionals; Environmental sustainability; Globalisation; Infrastructure systems; Rating system; Social equity; Social sustainability; Social-economic; Triple Bottom Line; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Achieving this goal is supported in part by the profession's fundamental mission: to address basic human needs and improve quality of life. However, analysis shows that when the preparation of engineers at universities focuses on traditional and technical skills, such a curriculum is insufficient for preparing graduates to tackle current global challenges, such as climate change, poverty, and the humanitarian crisis. As with the Washington Accord, engineering accreditation bodies increasingly recognise that these challenges demand a new kind of engineer equipped with a new set of competencies and capacities. In some cases, this has led to evolution, if not revolution, in engineering curricula as the social compact comes to the fore. This study examines what is happening and which initiatives are promoted to embed sustainability considerations in two civil engineering curriculums: one aligned with the Washington Accord (in Australia) and one not (from Colombia). The study proceeds from the understanding that while the volume and breadth of research about ensuring engineering education addresses sustainability well have increased rapidly during this century, there have been few empirical studies beyond a single institution's case. Furthermore, many case studies have also been limited to documenting changes in course maps or the explicit curriculum, i.e., what is overt in the documentation. In light of this, this research presents findings from a doctoral thesis that analyses educators' and students' experiences of the explicit and implicit-which is learnt from the organisation, intentions, attitudes and behaviours of the educators, for example, and what is not taught respectively-to provide a richer picture of what is understood and experienced as the intended and enacted curriculum. In general, findings suggest that accreditation systems (such as the Washington Accord) highly influence the adoption of educational responses towards sustainability in the civil engineering curriculum. The accreditation requirements ensure that sustainability is addressed in specific discipline-based units, and to a greater extent, in the capstone unit. Barriers, however, occur in both cases because sustainability considerations are not scaffolded. The cross-case analysis also shows that while project-based environments were the most common type of educational responses implemented to strengthen students' sustainability-based knowledge and skills, findings suggested projects do not always encourage the same complexity of problems and, consequently, do not generate the same level of learning outcomes. Results also reveal that hidden-curriculum responses were decisive for students to embrace new sustainability perspectives. Finally, the research also provides insight into future curriculum strategies for developing engineering education for sustainability. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Accreditation; Climate change; Curricula; Engineering education; Students; 'current; Case analysis; Civil engineering curriculum; Engineering sustainability; Human needs; Quality of life; Sustainability considerations; Sustainability education; Technical skills; Washington; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Two courses offered through the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering are discussed, specifically: CArE 2601 Fundamentals of Environmental Engineering; and CArE 5605 Environmental Modeling. The pedagogical approach to delivery of both courses included blended content delivery, a flipped classroom, and modified mastery learning. The approach to instruction and technology included conceptual understanding before spreadsheet modeling to verify concepts through application. The course content focused upon the topic of “triple bottom line accounting” (also known as “full cost accounting” or “true cost accounting”). This content was presented in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), where the three dimensions of sustainable development include economic (i.e., prosperity), social (i.e., people), and environmental (i.e., planet) considerations. One module asked the question, “how much would you pay for a sunset?” Another module asked the question, “how would you exchange transferrable discharge permits to create a low cost solution while ensuring a baseline for environmental services?” Student mastery learning to earn a grade of “C” was assessed through rapid feedback to quizzes administered via the Learning Management System (i.e., Canvas), and a buffet of optional assessment instruments to earn a grade of “B” or “A” included detailed grading of extended homework assignments performed individually. The rationale for the approach employed in these two courses includes a recognition that the practice of environmental engineering often is viewed as “driven by regulation”. The long-term goal of threading triple bottom line accounting to teaching sustainability across multiple courses includes helping future Professional Engineers position themselves and their employers within the emerging conceptual framework of “environmental, social, and corporate governance” or ESG (i.e., for the PE in Environmental Engineering to lead the corporate role of Chief Sustainability Officer). The lessons learned through this study included: 1) integrating economics into the environmental engineering classroom provides an authentic context to understand the importance of adopting a systems-level view of the trade-offs inherent as part of the triple bottom line; 2) future work should explore replication of the results in courses offered by other faculty and at other institutions as well as more broadly disseminated results to encourage the adoption of similar approaches in other courses within environmental engineering curricula. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Costs; Curricula; E-learning; Economic and social effects; Economics; Engineering education; Environmental regulations; Grading; Learning systems; Teaching; Conceptual understanding; Contents deliveries; Environmental model; Mastery learning; Missouris; Multiple course; Pedagogical approach; Science and Technology; Triple Bottom Line; Triple bottom line accountings; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

The active learning via project-based, activity-based, and service-based courses within the first-year engineering curriculum has proven effective for students not only to become more engaged and motivated but also to experience increased learning and retention. Generally, first-year engineering courses are meant to create student experiences that are meaningful, open-ended, and hands-on in addition to being an introduction to working and communicating effectively within teams. Whether one is an experienced educator or not, looking for project ideas to adapt, or developing projects that are of appropriate scope and value on your own or in collaboration with colleagues is challenging and time consuming. Although there is an abundance of peer reviewed work studying first-year projects or activities of many kinds, a composite repertoire for first year engineering project ideas is less available. The existing literature focuses on the tied research questions more than how the project is implemented for straightforward transfer to another classroom setting. Limited inventories, where individual ideas and projects are listed, exist; however, finding the project that fits one's needs again requires choosing the right keywords to start reading through multiple posts, folders and files, and is not straightforward. In this study, the authors surveyed faculty teaching introductory courses in engineering to explore the range of projects already developed, the basic details of the projects, and topics addressed in each. The online survey was utilized to collect faculty members' teaching approaches, preparation, activities, and materials needed, as well as self-reflection. Data analysis categorized first-year engineering projects (N=32) by the project outcomes, themes, extent within the course coverage, grading system, institutions' educational model, and the projects' inclusivity of other power/holistic skills. There were common features among the first-year introductory engineering courses including the engineering design process, teamwork, and professional communication.

With ABET's EAC Criterion 5 expansion, we see calls for increased embracement of diversity, equity, and inclusion as a profession. It is the duty of educators to convey to students that engineering decisions have broad reaching impacts on the community beyond their pure technicalities. As engineering decisions are made, elements concerning equity should be weighed along with classic performance benchmarks. This paper introduces an infrastructure decision-making game that highlights many different aspects of risk mitigation decision-making: equity, community impact, system performance, uncertainty, and resource constraint. In this game, teams make decisions about which elements of an electric network to repair and retrofit given constraints as hazards randomly impact the community. While making decisions, the teams must weigh many different metrics and be conscious of the sociodemographics across the community. The construction of this game proves an apt complement within classic educational structure, such as in a basic structural engineering course, where students can connect design retrofit strength levels with broader community impact. This game is applicable to students in high school, college-level, and also professionals as an introductory course module for complex multi-faceted risk mitigation engineering decision-making and the role of equity considerations in it. The game design is flexible and can include other impending issues such as climate adaptation. It also has potential to be expanded to include other social considerations such as diversity and inclusion.

Embracing sustainable infrastructure (SI) and utilizing effective project delivery methods (PDM) to deliver such complex projects can potentially facilitate addressing these issues while improving sustainability performance. That said, it is evident that to deliver SI projects, stakeholders should have sufficient knowledge of how the infrastructure sustainability rating system, i.e., Envision rating system can facilitate in implementation of alternative PDMs. Although higher education can potentially support future engineering professionals by nurturing critical sustainability requirements along with efficient delivery methods of SI projects, unfortunately, sustainability courses within higher education rarely focus on such correlations. Therefore, this research highlights the importance of educating architecture/engineering/construction (AEC) students on how the Envision rating system can aid in executing alternative PDMs for SI through leveraging integrated design. Therefore, this study piloted training in a sustainable construction class to introduce the students to key concepts of SI and PDMs for construction projects. To this end, the study conducted a pre-survey before the workshop to capture the existing knowledge of the participants about these concepts. During the workshop, the participants were introduced to various topics including traditional and alternative PDMs, integrated design, Envision Rating system and its credits, so that the students can draw connections and realize the interrelationships between SI and delivery methods. A post-survey was conducted after the training. The findings indicated that before the training, all the AEC students were not familiar with SI and their correlations with PDMs while deciding on a delivery method for such projects. Moreover, the results highlighted that the workshop improved the students' knowledge and skills in integrated design and boosted their confidence in participating in and delivering high-performance sustainable infrastructure projects. Finally, this study would be valuable for implementing SI and enhancing the project management skills of the future AEC workforce. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Engineering education; Microchannels; Project management; Sustainable development; Architecture engineering; Construction education; Delivery methods; Engineering constructions; High educations; Infrastructure project; Integrated designs; Project delivery; Rating system; Sustainable infrastructure; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

An integrated approach allows students to draw connections between different disciplinary content, develop professional skills through practice, and relate their emerging engineering competencies to the problems and communities they care about [4], [5]. Despite the known benefits, the challenges to implementing such major programmatic changes are myriad, including faculty's limited expertise outside their own disciplinary area of specialization and lack of perspective of professional learning outcomes across the curriculum. In 2020, Montana State University initiated a five-year NSF-funded Revolutionizing Engineering Departments (RED) project to transform its environmental engineering program by replacing traditional topic-focused courses with a newly developed integrated and project-based curriculum (IPBC). The project engages all tenure-track faculty in the environmental engineering program as well as faculty from five external departments in a collaborative, iterative process to define what students should be expected to know and do at the completion of the undergraduate program. In the process, sustainability, professionalism, and systems thinking arose as foundational pillars of the successful environmental engineer and are proposed as three knowledge threads that can be woven throughout environmental engineering curricula. The paper explores the two-year programmatic redesign process and examines how lessons learned through the process can be applied to course development as the team transitions into the implementation phase of the project. Two new integrated project-based learning courses targeting the 1st- and 2nd-year levels will be taught in academic year 2023-2024. The approach described in this work can be utilized by similar programs as a model for bottom-up curriculum development and integration of non-technical content, which will be necessary for educating engineers of the future. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Students; Sustainable development; Systems thinking; Accreditation criteria; Engineering education research; Environmental engineering curriculum; Environmental engineering programs; Integrated approach; Integrated programs; Learning outcome; Professional knowledge; Project based learning; Real-world experience; Engineers",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

This toolkit is to be used as a mechanism to engage a diversity of stakeholders to use their voices, experiences, and connections to share the need for national curricular change in engineering education widely. This toolkit can foster the integration of sustainability-focused learning outcomes into engineering courses and programs.

Catalyzed by The Lemelson Foundation and VentureWell, the EOP initiative provides teaching tools, grants, and support for the EOP Network -a volunteer action network- comprising diverse stakeholders collectively seeking to transform engineering education to equip all engineers with the understanding, knowledge, skills, and mindsets to ensure their work contributes to a healthy world. The EOP Framework, a fundamental resource of the initiative, provides a curated and vetted list of ABET-aligned sustainability-focused student learning outcomes, including core and advanced. It covers social and environmental sustainability topics and essential professional skills such as communication, teamwork, and critical thinking. It was designed as a practical implementation tool - rather than a research framework - to help educators embed sustainability concepts and tools into engineering courses and programs at all levels. The Lemelson Foundation has provided a range of grants to support curricular transformation efforts using the EOP Framework. With support from The Lemelson Foundation, ASEE launched an EOP Mini-Grant Program in 2022 to engender curricular changes using the EOP Framework. The EOP Network is working to extend the reach of the Framework across the ASEE community beyond initial pilot programs by implementing an EOP Toolkit for EOP Network members and other stakeholders to use at their home institutions, conferences, and informative workshops. This article describes the rationale for creating the EOP Toolkit, the development process, content examples, and use scenarios. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.","Bloom's Taxonomy; Environmental Engineering; SDGs; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable Engineering","Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Foundations; Teaching; Bloom taxonomies; Curricular changes; Engineering course; Engineering program; Grand Challenge; Industry needs; National Science Foundations; Sustainable development goal; Sustainable engineering; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

The cornerstone course teaches engineering design in a hands-on fashion with student groups tackling design projects that aim to address sustainability issues on campus. Previously, engineering ethics was introduced separately during a stand-alone and disconnected “ethics week”. This paper will provide details regarding the current implementation of ethics content, which is delivered in parallel with project progress and more closely relates to the design projects. Specific approaches include in-class team activities, case study review, individual scenario assignments, a team-based ethics simulation (previously developed and presented at ASEE), design project reflections, discussions of ethics through the lens of the three pillars of sustainability, and an individual final paper related to an on campus sustainability ethics scenario. In addition to providing an overview of ethics activities and assignments, this paper will compare course-level student learning outcomes between the current and prior years and how content in the course affected students' perception of engineering ethics. We expect that by more closely integrating ethics content with the student projects, students will engage more deeply with ethics and appreciate how engineering ethics affects everyday engineering practice, thus improving the self-reported learning outcomes of the course. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Engineering education; Philosophical aspects; Students; Sustainable development; Teaching; 'current; Bucknell University; Design course; Design programs; Engineering course; Engineering ethics; Evidence-based practices; First year; First year design; Paper evidence; Curricula",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

What can we do and what has been done to minimize or recycle plastic waste? Plastics have garnered a negative reputation over recent years due to the growing rate of plastic waste found in the environment. This paper will focus on how faculty from the Plastics Engineering Technology program will be developing modules throughout the curriculum to focus on sustainability at each stage of the product's life cycle. Materials, part and mold design, testing and processing courses will include content that brings awareness to the importance of creating a sustainable mindset. This initiative is part of the Training for Improving Plastics Circularity grant received from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through the Department of Commerce. The plastic product lifecycle can no longer be sustained as a linear process. The days of blindly designing a product without putting serious thought into the endgame has become a reckless practice and needs to change. Thoughtful design and processes are continuing to evolve as part of the movement towards Plastics Circularity. The circular economy is a systems solution framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste and pollution (Ellen, n.d.). The importance of this initiative is being supported by the US Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Training for Improving Plastics Circularity (TIPC) Grant Program aims to develop the future workforce needed to grow a circular economy for plastics. A circular economy is one in which materials retain their value through repeated reuse, repair, and recycling, and are finally discarded only as a last resort (Hanacek, 2022). This paper will focus on the initial planning stages of introducing this concept into existing plastics curriculum of an engineering technology program as part of the Training for Plastics Circularity (TIPC) grant funded through NIST. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Biodiversity; Climate change; Commerce; Elastomers; Engineering education; Life cycle; Molds; Plastic products; Plastic recycling; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Department of Commerce; Engineering technology program; Materials design; Mould design; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Part design; Plastic industry; Plastics waste; Product life cycles; Curricula",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

The study focuses on what students think about sustainability and how education affects their thought relative to SDC. The perceived importance of sustainable design and construction is analyzed based on students' source of knowledge, university education, and future aspirations toward sustainability goals. A survey designed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data was distributed among architecture and construction management students at different levels to investigate their perception of sustainability. In addition to providing insight into students' perception of courses taken that have components of SDC, this study examines students' aspiration of earning a LEED certificate, interest to continue the study of SDC after graduation, and career aspirations in SDC after graduation. Based on their major, this study also explored the degree to which students have made decisions about the potential relationship between knowledge gained and students' perception of the impact of sustainable design and construction options. Findings also indicate how perceptions compare between population groups, such as students of architecture and students of construction. Students seem to be best equipped to explain their understanding of the listed options based on their experiences. Such research outcomes can help educators better to implement SDC into respective curricula in the future.

Urban coastal communities are particularly at risk as their infrastructure is experiencing frequent inundation related to climate change impacts. Rising sea levels in coastal communities create backflow into stormwater systems and deplete capacity. In addition, the increase in rainfall intensity, duration, and frequency related to climate change create additional challenges for aging infrastructure systems. To prepare students to solve these challenges, the Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and Civil Engineering Technology (CET) programs at Old Dominion University (ODU) are introducing a new minor titled Engineering Solutions for Climate Adaptation and Resilience. This minor ensures that graduates understand how climate is changing, how it will impact society, and what solutions can be adopted to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The minor will incorporate two new classes, Managing the Climate Crisis, which will provide an understanding of climate science, the impacts, the associated hazards, and what solutions can be adopted to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and Adaptation to Sea Level Rise, which will explore solutions at the community and individual property scale to mitigate stormwater impacts related to climate change. The approach balances theory with practical engineering and technology solutions which can be adopted to mitigate the impacts of climate change related to stormwater in coastal communities. The minor is supported by existing courses in both curriculums related to sustainability, pollution prevention and green engineering, hydrology and hydraulics, and coastal engineering. This paper describes the need for the minor, the minor requirements, the methodology for establishing what coursework the minor requires, and the minor's availability to students. Furthermore, the learning objectives and course outlines for the two proposed courses that will be developed to support the minor will be thoroughly discussed.

Although such courses provide students with the knowledge required to assess the environmental impacts of existing products, services, and systems, they suffer from a few common weaknesses: (1) they focus more on analysis and much less on front-end design of environmentally sound products; (2) in many IE curricula, these are only elective courses; and (3) students tend to treat sustainability courses as a one-off class, and often lack a vision and clear next steps toward a career path in designing and innovating around sustainable products. To address the challenges above and to improve the skills and competency of engineering students, we have introduced in our sustainability course two additional sets of training - one on innovation and product design principles, practices, and methods and one on the entrepreneurial mindset. These additional training sets aim to: (1) encourage constant curiosity among students about our changing world and anticipate the challenges of currently accepted solutions; (2) make connections from many resources to intersect ideas; and (3) develop product designs that create environmental, economic, and social value. We also present insights into ISE curriculum changes that can strengthen these sustainability training elements. This effort would create entrepreneurs with engineering training who can innovate and design sustainable products and systems for the future. We are presently implementing this effort in our sustainability course and will share results from ongoing student projects and student surveys about their attitudes, skills, confidence, and viability for sustainability engineering as a career path. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,"Curricula; Ecodesign; Engineering education; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Product design; Professional aspects; Students; Career paths; Design systems; Engineering design; Engineering systems; Engineering training; Product service; Product systems; Sustainable products; Sustainable services; Sustainable systems; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program developed by U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) is one of the most popular sustainability practices that provide guidelines for the design and construction of any type of building. Due to its comprehensive and practical approach, it is very helpful to implement LEED guidelines and standards into the construction education curriculum to provide opportunities for students to become familiar with and learn how to apply these sustainability standards to the projects. In order to facilitate this, the US. Green Building Council (USGBC) has developed the LEED Lab program to provide this opportunity for students to become involved in a real-world project and practice sustainability during their education. Ball State University is one of the few universities that is offering LEED Lab to undergraduate students through which two campus buildings have been certified to date. In this course, students become involved in the process of certifying a campus building under LEED Operation and Maintenance (LEED O+M) for Existing Buildings. The purpose of this course is to provide a chance for students to gain hands-on experience and improve several skills besides learning a valuable experience about sustainability. However, this goal will not be achieved if the necessary skills are not infused into the course syllabus. Therefore, this study aims to indicate how the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) recommended competencies for a Career-Ready Workforce can be infused into the process of teaching LEED Lab to make sure the students are ready to use their pieces of training in their career. In this study, the NACE competencies (teamwork, Leadership, Professionalism, Technology, critical thinking, and communication) and the initial course learning outcomes of the LEED Lab are correlated to investigate the implementation of those competencies in the course. After discovering the lacking competencies in the course learning outcome, the appropriate learning outcomes were added to the course to cover those competencies. Specific assignments were then added to help achieve the new learning outcomes.

Although the construction industry has made significant improvements in environmental and economic sustainability in terms of promoting the adoption of renewable resources, low-carbon communities, and pro-environmental behavior, among others, there is a growing concern for lack of social sustainability in the industry. Social sustainability is a critical component of a community's wellbeing and longevity, yet it is one of the least prioritized concepts in sustainability debates. One of the main causes of social sustainability issues in the construction industry is the lack of education and awareness among the workforce. To address the gap, this research introduces a three-step pedagogical approach in construction education to prepare students in the field by developing cultural proficiency, critical thinking skills, and non-biased verbal communication skills. The study conducted the following three interventions: (1) social media-based learning activity; (2) cocurricular learning (i.e., in-class expert training); and (3) combination of problem-based learning (PBL) and conceptual model development activity (i.e., active learning activity). Overall, 111 students from two consecutive semesters (i.e., summer 2021 and fall 2021) participated in the interventions in three construction management (CM) courses (i.e., Sustainable Construction, Principles of Construction, and Sustainable Approach to Construction) at a minority-serving institution. The research integrated a mixed-method approach through the systematic collection of quantitative and qualitative data using questionnaire surveys and concept maps. A Wilcoxon signed-rank analysis evaluated the quantitative data obtained from the workshop's pre- and post-surveys, whereas the qualitative data were analyzed using sentiment analysis. The obtained results demonstrated the efficacy of the following three interventions: (1) improved collaboration among students through increasing their social network and sharing their perspectives, opinions, and graphical media content more efficiently; (2) increased students' awareness about unconscious biases as well as intercultural, persuasive, and verbal communication skills; and (3) improved their ability to conceptualize ideas and determine the implications of their decisions through concept maps. The findings of this study contribute to two bodies of knowledge. First, they contribute to sustainable construction by encouraging the integration of more robust initiatives on social sustainability education. Additionally, this study also contributes to engineering and construction ethics education by increasing students' awareness about the social dimension of sustainability such as equity, unconscious biases, microaggressions, stereotypes, prejudices, and cultural humility. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Economics; Education computing; Environmental protection; Project management; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Students; Surveys; Sustainable development; Communication skills; Concept maps; Learning Activity; Qualitative data; Quantitative data; Social sustainability; Students awareness; Sustainability knowledge; Sustainable construction; Verbal communications; Construction industry",Article,"",Scopus

Purpose/Hypothesis: We investigated whether undergraduate engineering students from 16 social identity groups perceived departmental climate differently from one another and examined psychological and behavioral factors contributing to these perceptions and their relationship to engineering identification. Design/Method: We surveyed 398 undergraduate engineering students about departmental climate and engineering identity, testing structural models across race and gender. Qualitative analysis of open-ended items complemented quantitative results. Results: Students rated climate for dominant identities (White, male, and/or US-born) as more welcoming than for 14 nondominant identities, broadening the notion of “nondominant” identities in engineering. In structural models, invariant across race and gender, students' perceptions of bias, safety, and faculty support predicted climate ratings; peer relations and microaggressions predicted engineering identity. There were mean differences in perceptions across intersections of race and gender, but students in all groups perceived a climate gap favoring dominant identities. Open-ended responses highlighted students' desire for a more diverse, inclusive program and the importance of peer relations. Conclusions: Departmental climate can be less welcoming for engineering students with many different nondominant identities. Attending to both students' own social positioning and their perceptions of climate for other students can open opportunities for change in engineering departments. Results suggest that efforts to improve peer relations in group work could be important in promoting disciplinary identification in historically marginalized groups. © 2023 American Society for Engineering Education.","climate; diversity; identity; inclusivity; survey; underrepresented students","Behavioral research; Climate change; Climate models; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Climate; Diversity; Identity; Inclusivity; Psychological factors; Social identity; Structural modeling; Student experiences; Undergraduate engineering students; Underrepresented students; Students",Article,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus

However, engineering activities are a key driver of climate change and engineers are responsible in many ways for disaster risk reduction. It is therefore imperative that engineering education accurately portrays the impact that the profession has on our climate and equips engineers with the knowledge to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt infrastructure for climate resilience. Here, we explore how higher education prepares engineers to address the climate crisis via a curricula analysis of three departments (mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering). The pilot study investigated the extent of mitigation and adaptation to climate change (MACC) content across different disciplines by developing and applying an evaluation methodology. We found that module descriptions and learning objectives were largely without reference to MACC, further evidencing the dissociation of engineering education from the climate reality as cited in the literature. This novel approach goes beyond curricula analysis to integrate MACC within module outlines paving the way for future integration.

This paper aims to show how the context of the pandemic, which demanded the transition from in-person classes to virtual classes, was used to illustrate better the concepts of life cycle assessment (LCA) for Production Engineering students in a Brazilian University. Design/methodology/approach: The research strategy used was action research. Throughout the discipline offering, the environmental impacts resulting from in-person and remote classes were comparatively assessed through a practical activity using LCA. Students’ behaviour and perception of the activities were recorded by the professor and discussed with the other researchers on the team. At the end of the course, students answered a questionnaire to assess their satisfaction with different aspects of the discipline, and these data were analysed via Fuzzy Delphi. Findings: The results focus on discussing the pedagogical aspects of this experience and not the environmental impacts resulting from each class modality. It was possible to notice a greater engagement of students when using a project that directly involved their daily activities (food, transportation, use of electronics, etc.) compared to the traditional approach of teaching LCA concepts. In this traditional approach, the examples focussed on the industrial sector, a more distant context from the reality of most students. Student feedback demonstrated great acceptance by them regarding the approach adopted.

It is essential that engineers understand these challenges and realize the impact their solutions have. This means that higher education's task in fostering future engineers as transformation agents is key. In this paper we introduce initial arguments about why engineering programs need to include both sustainability and entrepreneurship as core elements for students to obtain a holistic approach towards humanity's grand societal challenges, along with specific skills, including for example critical thinking and reflection, systemic thinking, building partnerships, and collaborations An overview of the literature shows that independent sustainability and entrepreneurship have been recognized as important for engineering programs, even though the integration of both has yet to be achieved. Furthermore, a first analysis of a sample of engineering programs in Germany confirms what we observed in the literature. It would appear that the time for a transformation of engineering programs has arrived. © 2023 Elsevier B.V..

The motivation of students to participate is increased especially by working out real-life problems. To provide this kind of practical learning experience, we are establishing a repair project for broken, otherwise discarded, lab equipment. It will not only help to reduce waste and save money by repairing research equipment, but will also encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. Providing a space to learn about the underlying functional properties of various often highly specialized lab instruments, students identify malfunctions, deepen understanding of vulnerable designs, and discuss and perform strategies for repairing them under guidance, while collecting credit points. Through gaining a deep understanding of how these instruments work, students may even invent new strategies to realize similar tasks or add new features. This project builds on the findings from a 2021 pilot study. We discovered that by offering a repair project, students were able to gain a deeper understanding of theoretical concepts, improve their self-confidence as well as their motivation in learning, and increase their awareness of sustainable design. In the following, we are presenting the transformation of the pilot study into a current course concept. With weekly mini-evaluations we are monitoring students' learning success towards their learning goals and share the results. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

The rise of climate disasters, such as floods, droughts, forest fires, and hurricanes, poses a threat to the survival of humans, animals, and plants. Despite scientists having warned about the impending dangers of high CO2 emissions, particularly from the global North for many years, there has been no political or technical solution in sight. Engineers are known for being problem-solvers, but what happens when the problem is complex and the consequences of technical interventions are hard to predict? In my paper, I propose measures to sensitize engineers to the complexity of climate change and sustainability. Based on the method of focused ethnography, I draw on Feminist teaching methods, my extensive teaching experience in the field of transdisciplinary gender research in science and technology studies, and my observations during the international “Winter school of ENHANCE on gender and diversity in science, technology and society” at Technische Universität Berlin in 2023. The paper concentrates on the content and pedagogical approaches that can be used to convey the complexity of the issue while fostering the development of critically reflective knowledge. By incorporating these measures, engineers can be better equipped to tackle the challenges posed by climate change and sustainability in a more holistic and thoughtful manner. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

This picture is worsened when considering the Institution of Engineering and Technology in 2021 found that only 7% of 1,000 UK engineering companies with a sustainability strategy had the staff with the skills to fulfil it. Against this backdrop, meeting our commitments with integrity, upskilling the current workforce urgently, and ensuring degree courses are future-fit are crucial. In response, these two new actionable tools aid educators in exploring and accelerating curriculum change. First, the Global Responsibility Competency Compass is an articulation of the essential skills, knowledge and mindsets required by the globally responsible practices society needs today. The Compass is designed for everyday professionals in the engineering sector looking to effectively navigate the complexity, uncertainty, and challenges of our age. Second, the Reimagined Degree Map, helps educators develop robust action plans to consider the broader purpose of engineering education and design relevant learning. The Map supports the translation of intention into tangible changes by designing regular learning about engineers' understanding of their global responsibilities and how to navigate through them. This presentation will describe the context and process of the tools' development and present feedback from key stakeholders and early adopters. Early results suggest the tools can support educators in collaboratively embedding sustainability and global responsibility as a core tenet across higher engineering education. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

LAES requires the same required math and science courses of standard engineering degrees, adding upper-level concentrations split equally between advanced engineering and humanities courses. LAES was designed for retaining and recruiting a diversity of students in engineering, and to address recent innovations in industrial practice, technology design, and community-centered education. Through fifteen years of trial and error, the LAES program has developed a set of meaning-filled design guidelines for project work, combining engineering and humanistic problem solving with sustainable environmental practice integrated throughout every aspect of design, production, and use. In partnership with many departments across campus, especially Cal Poly's architecture program, LAES has worked on many projects that exist within the complex economic, political, social, spatial, and cultural needs of local communities. LAES projects in collaboration with architecture students, have ranged from community housing construction with re-purposed shipping containers, to re-designing pedestrian neighborhood corridors, to the use of narrative-driven STEM education modules with underserved middle school students, to the design of immersive-reality explorations of artificial coral ecologies off the coast of California. In this paper, we review what we have learned from our project work, with a focus on student learning assessment, leadership training, working across disciplines, and teamwork management, demonstrating how those practical academic concerns interact with the instruction of our design principles. We conclude by offering practical recommendations for how other programs may use some of our design guidelines and project ideas within their own curriculums. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

This in turn necessitates the need for a comprehensive, tailored, and relevant overarching conceptual framework to be constructed to ensure that our subsequent generations of engineers are equipped to efficiently tackle existential societal problems including anthropogenic climate change and the multi-faceted nature of sustainable development. This paper motivates, details, and presents a conceptual framework for implementing successful engineering teams in tertiary engineering projects. The emergent conceptual framework presented is currently a work in progress based on the findings and recommendations of current literature. We plan to undertake student interviews with both first year and capstone students to refine our framework thereby ensuring the credibility of the framework. The final theoretical framework is composed of four key themes, these being team composition, team dynamics, creative leadership and team culture. The theoretical composition and relevance of their component sub-themes are discussed further in our work in addition to the unique interplay that occurs at the nexus of said themes and sub-themes. Ultimately this paper does not only define and outline a holistic conceptual framework to be used as a heuristic device for implementing successful engineering teams, but it additionally highlights current gaps in the relevant literature thereby provoking critical fields of future research. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

In this study, we investigated if and if so, how far resilience-related competencies are addressed within engineering study programs. Based on a content analysis, the learning outcomes from 48 study programs of five leading technical universities in Europe were analysed. The results indicate a lack of both resilience-related competencies within engineering programs and a consistent implementation of learning outcomes within the European Higher Education Area.

This study examined the effect of a learning experience that integrated engineering systems design and speculative fiction writing to engage 48 high school science students in imagining sustainable climate futures. Students wrote three climate fiction stories: an individually-authored story and a group-authored story during the introductory session, and a final group-authored story.

While working on complex issues, engineering students learn to deal with different kinds of uncertainty: uncertainty about the dynamics of a real-world challenge, the knowledge gaps in the problem, or the conflicting perspectives amongst the people involved. Although we know from previous research that students are likely to encounter these uncertainties in sustainability challenges, which metacognitive strategies they use to deal with them is unclear. We interviewed nine MSc students at the end of a challenge-based course at a Dutch university of technology. We asked the students how they dealt with uncertainty in collaboration with the commissioner, their student team, and the teachers. The interviews were analyzed through grounded, consensus-based coding by two researchers. Preliminary results show students use three main strategies. First, the different perspectives from peers in their team inform the position of the student. Second, students find expectation management of the commissioner essential, yet students struggle with how to do this in a professional and timely way. Third, students frame the uncertainties they encounter as part of the learning process, which allows them to accept the possibility of failure. This study provides first insights in metacognitive uncertainty strategies and suggests those strategies should become a more prominent topic in coaching students. When uncertainty becomes an explicit part of challenge-based education, students learn to deal with both the known and unknown in the transition to a sustainable society. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

Scholars have been proposing methods to achieve sustainability and they emphasize the importance of educating citizens about the ethics of sustainability. Also, in the educational context, there is a trend in applying gamification concepts to promote sustainability. Previous studies have demonstrated that gamification can engage students through interactive content and reward systems, so that they can be motivated to learn and apply knowledge. Nevertheless, limited articles can be found to propose methods for developing technological applications for green innovation education. In addition, scant interest has been shown to include gamification in sustainability education, especially in Hong Kong. Knowing that simulation games may raise students' curiosity to learn, we designed an augmented-reality-based educational mobile application to investigate their perception of engaging technologies and gamification in the learning process of sustainability education. In this application, there are three major components to be presented. First, various simulation games are included to educate learners with practical skills to nurture sustainable living habits. Cartoons and animations are added to better explain abstract ecological theories, and learners can interact with game characters/elements in real-time motion for an advanced gaming experience. Second, to motivate students to learn the content, digital achievement badges can be earned after winning the mini-games and they can be shared on social media platforms. It is expected that the reward system can attract students to participate actively. Last but not least, the application is hoped to engage Hong Kong citizens and the globe in the Green Deck project of Hong Kong and encourage more social involvement. With reference to the application structure, this study is expected to explore the effects of implementing games and augmented reality on education for sustainable development. Two surveys (pre- and post-surveys) would be established to evaluate the students' learning experience and knowledge acquisition on sustainability. © 2023 Dechema e.V..

In this paper, we present a research study that assessed undergraduate students' understanding of sustainability after participating in a case study discussion. We designed and implemented a role-play case study of e-scooters on a college campus. The case facilitated “near transfer,” as it focused on an issue most students have personally experienced. Furthermore, the role-play component simulated a real-world context and allowed students to take different perspectives related to the topic, resulting in a discussion of social, political, economic, and technical factors related to sustainability. The case study was implemented with 38 students. Course readings and pre-case study assignments were used by students to prepare for the role-play. Students participated in groups of 6-7 participants in student-led discussions. To evaluate the development of perspectives, we undertook a thematic analysis of the pre- and post-assignment questions using a framework derived from Transformative Learning Theory (TLT).

The study of the Earth system is relevant to the understanding of environmental issues and the interplay between the sub-systems of the Earth (atmosphere, geosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere) . Yet, integration of Earth system literacy in the engineering curriculum has received minimal attention. This paper discusses the sustainability competencies in engineering education and, investigates if they can be addressed through Earth system literacy where weak or lacking. Based on two geology courses delivered to engineering students focusing on the sustainable management of different Earth resources with an understanding of their formation and extraction, it is evident that Earth system literacy can strengthen system thinking and, strategic and normative competencies in engineers. Most importantly it can target anticipatory competency that is not addressed adequately in conventional engineering courses. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

This means that a problem that is already challenging, namely planning, executing, and controlling logistical processes, gets even more complex and requires aspects of systems thinking to incorporate environmental and social impacts. Classical approaches of teaching, e.g. lectures with presentations and short exercises on closed problems, do not do justice to the complexity and intricacies of the topic sustainability. In such a context, project-based learning (PBL) where students do group work on open-ended problems with real-world complexity seems to be a more adequate means to teach the subject. The paper describes a PBL course in which students worked on projects to conceptualize micro-depots for parcel delivery in different areas of Düsseldorf. A micro-depot is a temporary storage location in a city from which parcels can be delivered by cargo bikes. The aim was to locate the micro-depot, design the delivery routes, check the feasibility, and calculate the reduction of greenhouse gases and other emissions. The course was taught in cooperation with a partner from the courier, express, and parcel delivery industry. The paper describes the experiences with the course and gives recommendations for a successful implementation of PBL in courses on sustainability. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

Design/Method: Focus group discussions with instructional teams and student interviews are examined to elucidate how course activities improved student transdisciplinary knowledge. Threshold concepts frame the qualitative analysis of the collected data. Implications for teaching and learning are discussed. Findings: Results suggest the investigated learning activities support student development of transdisciplinary knowledge as indicated by changes in systems thinking, metacognition, and empathic thinking. Where prior quantitative exploratory studies revealed little change in transdisciplinary knowledge indicators pre- and post-course, deeper qualitative analysis uncovers students manifested improvements in transdisciplinary knowledge indicators as narrated by the students themselves and as observed by instructors and teaching assistants.

This qualitative methods study aimed to analyze the extent to which a teaching approach, based on the in the integration of Freire's critical pedagogy and Multimodal literacy frameworks, promotes first-year engineering students' development of critical consciousness. Drawing from Paulo Freire's work on critical pedagogy, the critical consciousness framework emphasizes that individuals and their practice in community awaken critical awareness of their surroundings, including the interconnectedness that exists between economic, social, political, cultural, historical, and environmental factors. To this end, we designed an activity for students to research and create videos that illustrate the interconnectedness that exists between these factors. The activity provided an opportunity to build, express, and shape their thoughts regarding the connections between the designed world and its implications on society (i.e., who wins, who loses, who is involved, etc.). Preliminary analysis identified that multimodal video production allowed students to investigate and express their own interpretations of socio-political and sustainability issues related to the use of precious minerals, specifically cobalt. Furthermore, students included descriptions of their proposals for reducing child labor abuse in cobalt mining and identified the environmental impacts of excessive use of cobalt in technological devices. Overall, this research suggests that integrating critical consciousness and multimodal literacies can be an effective strategy for promoting engineering students' formation in terms of engineering design, literacy, sustainability, and social awareness. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

Situating sustainability learning within disciplinary contexts is needed for learners to apply sustainability theory to their future professions. Furthermore, developing capabilities is important to enable graduates to act in differing professional contexts. In response to these needs, this paper contextualises safety as part of sustainability in undergraduate engineering studies by exploring the complementarity between professional capabilities for safety in engineering and key capabilities found in sustainability education literature. The paper draws on findings from interviews with 41 pipeline engineers undertaken to build an understanding of differing views on engineering capabilities necessary for safety decision making. The results show synergies between safety and sustainability capabilities in the context of engineering practice and the opportunities to contextualise safety within sustainability in engineering education. From a safety perspective, given the expanding sustainable development agenda, there is an opportunity to increase education for public safety in engineering curricula within the scope of sustainability education and to shift learning from competencies to capabilities-based outcomes. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","capability; competence; Engineering curriculum; public safety; sustainability",,Article,"",Scopus

This qualitative exploration at a research-intensive engineering school draws on interviews and focus groups to explore teachers' ideas about developing individual transversal skills. We frame our analysis with a model that distinguishes three phases for skill development: conceptual knowledge (knowing), procedural skills (doing) and meta-cognitive/emotional reflection (learning from doing). We are particularly interested in the potential for play to create favorable conditions for developing transversal skills by enabling (i) focused experiential learning, (ii) low-stakes experimentation, (iii) rapid feedback, (iv) opportunity for reflection. In the interviews, the potential to teach conceptual disciplinary knowledge dominated teachers' perceptions and transversal skills were sidelined. Focus group participants, just after a hands-on activity, primarily addressed transversal procedural skills in their comments and overlooked the conceptual knowledge underpinning these skills. The importance afforded to meta-cognitive and meta-emotional reflection varied greatly amongst teachers. Our analysis suggests that the three-level model can assist teachers by providing a structure to ensure each level is accounted for in experiential activities. We see promise for addressing transversal skills including sustainability, risk assessment, ethical reasoning and emotional regulation. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

Concurrently, the UK's Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) has estimated that over 250,000 new workers will be needed by 2027 to meet demand. Besides this need for green skills, the sector is also looking towards more sustainable building materials, methods, and technologies, such as homegrown biogenic offsite manufactured (bio-OSM) timber: an innovative technology requiring additional engineering and manufacturing expertise. To address this critical skills gap, the Timber Technology, Engineering, and Design (TED) Competency Framework was established by a coalition of academic and industry partners. This framework then informed the development of a hybrid training course that can prepare the next generation of timber engineers with the knowledge, transferable skills, and industry experience that can drive change towards sustainability in the built environment and inform a transformational approach in engineering education. This practice paper describes the development of the Timber TED framework and the launch of the corresponding training programme in September 2022. It also reflects on the initial implementation across two cohorts, delivered at the Centre for Advanced Timber Technology at the New Model Institute for Technology and Engineering in Hereford, England, in partnership with Edinburgh Napier University and Timber Development UK.

The need for students to develop and demonstrate resilience seems particularly pertinent within engineering education. Firstly, engineering degrees are often associated with heavy workloads. This, alongside high rates of attrition and increases in mental health issues, suggests a need for students to demonstrate resilience. Secondly, engineering degrees prepare students for a profession, and it is likely that courses place emphasis on graduate attributes such as resilience. Finally, the rate of technological advancement and societal change places additional demands on graduates to adapt to career changes. Despite the emphasis on the benefits of demonstrating resilience, there is a lack of research focusing on how it is understood and taught within engineering education. In this work we take a qualitative approach to understanding how engineering educators conceptualise resilience; whether they feel a responsibility to help students develop resilience; their approach to doing this; and their general perception about the resilience levels of students. In so doing, we make use of data collected from semi-structured interviews with thirteen individuals involved in the education of engineers. Interview transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis (RTA). We find that the conceptualisation of resilience in engineering education varies, thus impacting the design of effective interventions. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

This study aims to report an effort to significantly update an existing engineering programme in IT with this ambition and to analyse the effects and challenges associated with the transformation. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a combination of action-oriented research based on implementing key changes to the curriculum; empirical investigations including surveys and interviews with students and teachers, and analysis of these; and a science and technology studies-inspired analysis. Findings: Respondents were generally positive towards adding topics relating to sustainability. However, in the unmaking of traditional engineering subjects, changes created a conflict between core versus soft subjects in which the core subjects tended to gain the upper hand. This conflict can be turned into productive discussions by focusing on what kinds of engineers the authors’ educate and how students can be introduced to societal problems as an integrated part of their education. Practical implications: This study can be helpful for educators in the engineering domain to support them in their efforts to transition from a (narrow) focus on traditional disciplines to one where the bettering of society is at the core.

Several researchers have proposed educational interventions and design tools for sustainable design education. The timing of introducing such interventions, particularly in project-based courses, could influence the effectiveness of these interventions, and these effects remain largely unexplored. Our aim in this research is to investigate this research gap through a mixed-methods experiment conducted with first-year engineering design students. Specifically, we introduced a two-day module on sustainable design either in the first or sixth week of an 8-week long design project. The effects of this variation were compared by analyzing (1) changes in students' trait empathy, (2) changes in their beliefs, attitudes, and intentions towards sustainability, and (3) their responses to a reflection assignment collected at the end of the semester/design project. From the results, we see that the timing of the sustainable design intervention did not relate to changes in students' trait empathy or their beliefs, attitudes, and intentions towards sustainability. However, students from both timing conditions reported significant increases in their attitudes and intentions towards sustainable action. Finally, students who received the intervention later more frequently mentioned the use of sustainable design heuristics in their reflection responses. Taken together, these findings suggest the need for educators to consider the timing of sustainable design interventions, especially when integrating them into longer project-based courses. © 2023 TEMPUS Publications.","empathy; engineering design education; student experiences; sustainability","Curricula; Ecodesign; Engineering education; Students; Timing circuits; Design curricula; Design programs; Educational intervention; Empathy; Engineering design; Engineering design education; Environmental sustainability; Integrate sustainability; Project-based course; Student experiences; Sustainable development",Article,"",Scopus

The approach, which has already been implemented across a number of different design and innovation modules, consists of two distinct phases. In the first, students are educated about sustainability and related issues. In the second phase, students are educated for sustainability and are taught to identify, define and solve problems so they can plan, develop and implement solutions to complex sustainability challenges/problems. Implementing this approach has raised questions, particularly in relation to helping students deal with conflicting requirements, understanding the limitations of their own knowledge, and the relationship between ethics and sustainability.

However, social sustainability is seldom prioritized in the construction industry. In construction education, the curriculums tend to focus on disseminating the fundamentals of the only two pillars, i.e., Economic and Environmental, thereby indicating that social sustainability is the weakest pillar. In the era of globalization and diversity, engineering professionals are increasingly grappling with communication styles due to generational and intercultural differences, biases in the workforce, and conflicts due to overlapping cultures that directly impact social sustainability. This pilot project aims to highlight the factors that create marginalization in the construction industry and recommend pedagogical solutions in construction education across the U.S. to address this marginalization directly. To achieve this objective, the study implemented workshop and associated activities in construction management (CM) classes about key components of social sustainability that includes effective interpersonal and group communication, with emphasis on how systemic racism makes its way into these processes as well as the role of culture and bias in communication. At the beginning of the class, 75 students participated in a pre-survey to record their pre-established knowledge about unconscious biases and the role of culture in communication. Then, during the training, students were introduced to topics such as: (1) key concepts of race, culture, and ethnicity; (2) identify differences between diversity, inclusion, and equity; (3) concepts of unconscious biases and their impact on people; and (4) concepts of microaggression. After the training, all the students who participated in the training completed the post-course survey as well. The pre-survey results indicated that more than 50 percent of students are not familiar with the concepts of unconscious biases. The results of the McNemar test indicated that guided training related to unconscious biases significantly improves students' understanding of systemic racism and ways to address social sustainability issues, particularly in the construction discipline. The findings of the study would be valuable for increasing awareness of implicit bias and enhancing the interpersonal skills of the future STEM workforce. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.","Construction education; Cultural Competence; Marginalization; Social Sustainability; Unconscious Bias","Construction industry; Engineering education; Project management; Surveys; Sustainable development; Communication styles; Construction education; Cultural competence; Engineering professionals; Globalisation; Marginalization; Social sustainability; Social-economic; Triple Bottom Line; Unconscious bias; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Some of the benefits of industrial 3D printing are the feasibility to develop affordable cookie-cut housing, rapid work completion, reduced margin of error, and minimal waste production. With the increase of homelessness and lack of low-income housing in the U.S. and worldwide, there is a pressing need to leverage our technological innovations to serve such communities by offering affordable and sustainable housing equitably. 3D printing is one of those solutions which has the potential to meet the challenging intricate requirements associated with design, materials, sustainability, construction methods, and maintenance/operation. Despite that civil engineering and construction management (CM) curricula do not often integrate 3D printing as a tool to tackle designing and building affordable housing, it is critical to incorporate such emerging technology within the construction curricula to prepare our future workforces. This goal of the study highlights the need for and importance of 3D printing in the construction domain and how it can be used as a valuable tool to construct affordable housing. To achieve this goal, the study pursued twofold approaches: 1) implementing an educational module within undergraduate and graduate courses followed by discussion sessions; and (2) surveying students to capture motivation, interest, team working skills, knowledge acquisition, experiences, and expectations about 3D printing technology. The study utilized box plots and an ordered probit regression model to analyze the obtained data. The results indicate that many CM students lack skills and knowledge in 3D printed building construction technology, but almost 98% of students showed positive interest to learn more about 3D printing technology in a complete course, which currently, if offered in some programs, is optional and part of the elective courses. The ordered probit regression analysis indicates that the implemented module is effective to increase students' interest in 3D printing technological skills. Additionally, the results also demonstrated that students with lower level of skills in robotic machine operation, data preparation, and programming skills as well as those who currently work in the construction industry are more likely to be inclined towards developing skills and knowledge in 3D printing technology. The findings benefit both academics and industry stakeholders to better inform engineering and construction curriculum. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022","3D printing; Construction education; Low-cost housing; Technological skills","Construction industry; Costs; Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Housing; Project management; Regression analysis; Students; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Affordable housing; Construction education; Construction management; ITS applications; Low-cost housings; Ordered probit; Printing technologies; Technological skills; 3D printers",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Universities like Boise State University (BSU) are starting to place greater emphasis on the inclusion of sustainability concepts in different engineering program curricula. As part of a project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the BSU mechanical engineering program integrates sustainability concepts specifically by using active learning modules (ALMs) suitable for each student's education level, progressing from freshman to senior. ALMs have shown to be more effective in improving motivation in the classroom compared to traditional learning. A modified survey instrument was developed for distribution to BSU mechanical engineering, engineering plus students, and alumni; both the student and alumni survey was modified using the 2009 American Society of Mechanical Engineerings' (ASME) sustainability survey with a combination of a study by Natasha Lanziner. Current mechanical engineering and engineering plus students were surveyed to gauge their knowledge and attitudes toward sustainability in the curriculum. Mechanical engineering alumni were surveyed to determine which sustainability practices are utilized in their workplaces. By applying a quantitative approach to the survey instrument, Boise State Engineering students and alumni will have the opportunity to express their perception of BSU's current integration of sustainability concepts. The data presents common sustainability trends based on the gender demographics of both students and alumni data. Specifically, the student data illustrates their general thoughts regarding ALMs and sustainability; most students, especially women, showed interest in sustainability when exposed to BSU alumni applying sustainability to their design work. As a general trend based on the alumni data, women also tended to feel less confident in applying sustainability to their design work. However, they were more interested in the concept than men.

However, given the wide social and cultural heterogeneity across US university contexts (e.g., differences in regional demographics, history, political climates), it is an open question if and how the intervention may scale. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team across three strategically selected universities to design, test, and iteratively improve an approach to systematically identify which first and second year courses would most benefit from the intervention, reveal student concerns that may be specific to that course, adapt the intervention to address those concerns, and evaluate the universality versus specificity of the intervention across university contexts. This systematic approach also includes persuasion and training processes for onboarding the instructors of the targeted courses. The instructor onboarding and the intervention adaptation processes are guided by a theory-of-action that is the backbone of the project's research activities and iterative process improvement. A synergistic mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods is used throughout the study.

University engineering programs can be a pivotal place for future engineers to gain understanding of sustainability and its importance, including in first-year courses. At the University of Colorado Boulder, three courses for first year engineering students are uniquely integrating sustainability. The courses selected for this study are 1) First-Year Engineering Projects, 2) Introduction to Civil Engineering, and 3) Introduction to Global Engineering. First-Year Engineering Projects provides students with the opportunity to use an iterative process to solve real engineering design problems. Introduction to Civil Engineering surveys the discipline and incorporates learning goals on ethics and sustainability. Introduction to Global Engineering addresses the engineer's role in identifying and acting on global poverty challenges. In this paper, we describe the explicit and implicit learning goals with respect to sustainability in these courses. We then map the sustainability content to the three pillars of sustainability, the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, and Bloom's Taxonomy of Cognitive Levels. At the end of the Fall 2021 semester, students in each of the three courses were asked to complete a survey that used 7-pt Likert-type items to evaluate student interest and motivation toward sustainability and 11-point rating items on confidence/self-efficacy. Student perception on sustainability was found to differ by: course, discipline, gender, major, student previous knowledge, and student general interests. Within each course, impactful factors include the learning objectives, quantity of sustainability inclusion and method of delivery. A given course is not the sole determining factor of students' awareness of sustainability, but it can have an effect. Sustainability can look different across engineering disciplines, and each area and method of incorporating sustainability has its own place, value, and impact. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",,"Curricula; Engineering education; Iterative methods; Students; Surveys; Engineering program; First year; First year engineering course; First year engineering projects; First-year engineering; Global engineerings; Integrate sustainability; Iterative process; Learning goals; University of Colorado; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Indeed, the minority students' exposure to active learning methods such as problem-based learning (PBL) can effectively foster their capability to deal with open-ended technical problems in their future careers. Additionally, the interactive nature of such methods can facilitate knowledge retention of emerging and effective sustainability concepts. This study highlights how the PBL technique can develop soft skills during sustainability education to Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) students at a minority-serving institution as an effort to promote professional skills of underrepresented groups, i.e., women of color, Latinos/Hispanics in a classroom. This study designed and implemented a PBL activity in a cross-listed Sustainable Approach to Construction course which introduced the students to: (1) sustainable infrastructure and Front-End Planning (FEP) techniques; and (2) how they complement each other to build sustainable infrastructure systems effectively. Sustainable infrastructure systems are critical to reducing social, economic, and environmental impacts on the built environment and FEP can complement building infrastructure systems sustainably by providing effective planning, better scope definition, and improved decision-making. A post-activity survey allowed the 35 AEC students to evaluate the improvement of their sustainability knowledge as well as multiple professional skills including leadership, communication, critical thinking ability, working in teams, and project management through the activity. The results indicated that most of the students including minorities had substantial improvement in their professional skills as well as advanced their knowledge in both areas of infrastructure sustainability and Front-End Planning. Furthermore, the analysis of the open-ended questions revealed that the students valued the PBL method because it offers interactivity, teamwork, an interdisciplinary knowledge-sharing platform, and the ability to simulate a real-life work environment. The findings of this study reveal the positive outcome of the implemented approach by integrating PBL activity in sustainability education for minority students from AEC majors.

The application of sustainability principles when considering physical structures can lead to the formation of more sustainable solutions to various civil engineering issues. Erosion control is one of the situations where ecology would be most useful. In this project, a nature center located in northwest Ohio is home to 109 acres of natural forests and farmland, has been experiencing erosion problems from water runoff. Students were tasked with designing an erosion system to prevent runoff and manage stormwater. It is easy to become engrained in the traditional grey infrastructure solutions that have grown so common in society. Instead, the team developed a design that contributes to the natural ecology of the site and constructs a new sustainable habitat for the wildlife in the area. To construct this new green solution, the team chose to incorporate a multitude of grass swales, check dams, and adaptive vegetation. The adaptive vegetation and grass swales are used to create new habitats for the wildlife around the site, which helps to make the site sustainable by providing more usable space and resources for the wildlife that live in the area. Check dams considered as grey infrastructure are constructed to eradicate the current runoff issue. The goal is to blend grey and green infrastructure solutions to develop a sustainable solution for the ecosystem and environment. This project not only requires students to apply the knowledge of Civil Engineering in designing the structures but also to learn about ecology to promote sustainability for the local community. This paper outlines the entire design process from conception to completion, with emphasis on problem definition, development of design concepts, interactions with stakeholders, and development of the detailed design.

Yet, all too often, engineering undergraduates are required to leave their passions, interests, and causes at the door when they enter the discipline, which may contribute to some engineering students' alienation and attenuation from the field. This study aims to address this challenge (and opportunity) by highlighting preliminary findings from an engineering faculty professional development (PD) experience. The PD experience aimed to teach engineering faculty how bio-inspired design and STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) can be coupled and used as a compliment when teaching the entrepreneurial mindset (EM) to broaden participation within the engineering disciplines. The guiding research question was as follows: How does the entrepreneurial mindset, bio-inspired design, and STEAM-integrated engineering instruction support engineering educator curriculum development? The data collection instrument was in the form of a workshop “exit ticket” which asked participants to respond to open-ended questions and photovoice reflections. The preliminary findings highlighted four key themes: (1) multiple perspectives, (2) intersectionality focus of arts, (3) benefits of learning that go beyond this PD, and (4) desire to learn more. These findings, obtained from participants at the beginning of the professional development (PD) experience, were significant enough to justify modifying the current and future PD experience. In general, the faculty participants expressed higher initial confidence with EM than with bio-inspired design and STEAM, but more growth in their bio-inspired and STEAM confidence than EM. From a practical perspective, the authors encourage PD facilitators and/or curriculum designers to implement a similar qualitative-based “exit ticket” (i.e., assessment) which incorporates both open-ended questions and photovoice in an effort to gain deeper and richer insights from participants, especially faculty participants. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",,"Biomimetics; Climate change; Engineering education; Steam; Bio-inspired designs; Design technologies; Development experiences; Engineering disciplines; Engineering faculty; Engineering undergraduates; Open-ended questions; Professional development; Science technologies; Societal problems; Curricula",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

The goal of the study is to demonstrate best practices to integrate sustainability concepts throughout four years of Bachelor's programs under the AEC curricula based on recommendations from sustainability experts including the Envision Academic Committee which works towards enriching and supporting sustainable education. Moreover, this study advocates for integrating and encouraging students to obtain sustainability credentials, particularly credentialing of the ISI-Envision rating system, Envision sustainability professional (ENV SP) during sustainability education. Given the importance of infrastructure systems for a functional community and the potential of the Envision rating system to particularly address the infrastructure challenges to develop sustainable and equitable projects, AEC programs should not only restrict their curricula to teach sustainable building rating systems. The outcomes of this research include: 1) capture various effective sustainability teaching efforts, which have been adopted by the sustainability instructors in their respective institutions; 2) nurture a platform to guide interested instructors to adopt sustainability as well as Envision system within AEC and STEM through proposing a matrix/framework to effectively integrate infrastructure sustainability into the existing engineering curriculum; and 3) discuss available means to pursue sustainability credentials, i.e., ENV SP during their courses. This study comprehends a qualitative approach to demonstrate best practices and effective methods for integrating sustainability concepts as well as sustainability credentialing in AEC curricula. The findings of this study guide to AEC faculty best practices when integrating sustainable infrastructure rating systems into architectural design studios, capstone engineering, and sustainability construction courses. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.","Engineering education; Equitable infrastructure; Sustainability Professional; Sustainable infrastructure","Climate change; Curricula; Engineering education; Intelligent buildings; Teaching; Architecture education; Architecture engineering; Best practices; Construction workforces; Engineering and construction education; Equitable infrastructure; Infrastructure systems; Rating system; Sustainability professional; Sustainable infrastructure; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Given that, traditional defense structures alone can hardly protect the vulnerable communities, particularly against flood disasters, there is a pressing need to explore adaptive and innovative solutions and embrace them in AEC education. Safe-to-Fail is such a resilient design strategy that anticipates failures during infrastructure systems planning, thus accommodating innovative strategies and reducing the impact of natural disasters. Therefore, this research advocates incorporating the resilient Safe-to-Fail concept in the AEC curricula to cultivate infrastructure resilience knowledge among the future minority engineering workforces. The objectives of this study are to: (1) identify the factors influencing AEC students' perceptions towards learning Safe-to-Fail; and (2) investigate students' pedagogical preferences to incorporate the Safe-to-Fail concept in AEC curricula. To achieve these objectives, the study developed a framework including a comprehensive lecture on Safe-to-Fail and its applications followed by an interactive discussion session and a survey to capture students' experiences, expectations, and perceptions. The framework was implemented in a cross-listed Sustainable Approach to Construction course in an educational institution located in a hurricane-prone state. 55 AEC students who were registered in the course participated in the framework and shared their level of interest as well as a preferred pedagogical approach to integrating the Safe-to-Fail concept in the curricula through the survey. The findings indicated that most of the participating students, mainly minorities, preferred to learn the Safe-to-Fail concept as a portion of an elective course and that the choice of learning such emerging concept is significantly correlated to the student's age, duration spent in the program, and prior knowledge of Safe-to-Fail. This study fills in the literature gaps through shedding light on the significance of integrating emerging and effective design strategy Safe-to-Fail as part of the teaching effort to AEC students particularly the underrepresented minorities. Integrating Safe-to-Fail in the curricula can foster disaster resilience knowledge and skills within the AEC minority students thus nurturing their ability to contribute to a sustainable and resilient built environment as well as provide an edge for future competitive careers. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022","Construction education; Infrastructure systems; Natural disasters; Resilient design; Safe-to-Fail","Disasters; Engineering education; Floods; Hurricanes; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Architecture engineering; Construction education; Design strategies; Engineering constructions; Infrastructure design; Infrastructure systems; Natural disasters; Resilient design; Safe-to-fail; Student perceptions; Curricula",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Making room for these essential topics is an important part of how engineering as a course of study and as a profession navigates our current global pollution epidemic. This paper is on the assessment of a new interdisciplinary course on sustainability and alternative energy offered to Art, Architecture, and Engineering students at The Cooper Union, a small, primarily undergraduate institution. The course provides students with an introduction to sustainability and sustainable development, the basics of energy conversion and storage technologies, and life cycle assessment. As the problems of sustainable development are interdisciplinary, our goal was to attract a multidisciplinary group of students to inspire discussion and different ways of thinking around the political, cultural, and technical components of a near-zero carbon energy future. We demonstrate that students not only learned the material, but also gained a greater appreciation for the climate crisis and how to engineer for sustainability. Course content and structure was aimed to be as interactive as possible, including extensive in-class discussion activities as well as two large group projects where students presented their findings to the class. We intentionally incorporated content and student activities on social equity, environmental justice, and the unequal impacts of a changing climate. Assessment was via student course evaluations, where they reflected on the delivery methods of the course and what they learned. Student survey responses were overwhelmingly positive - students enjoyed the diverse cohort and set of topics, the focus on group work and active discussion via Zoom, and the projects (on a specific renewable electricity generation site and a life cycle assessment). Survey results show that Engineering students were initially more interested in course topics related to technology whereas Art/Architecture students were more interested in course topics related to cultural and political issues; however, after the course, student interest in these topics converged and there was no discernable difference in interest levels across course topics between the two cohorts. We show that students gained an increased appreciation for (and understanding of) both the science/technology and ethical trade-offs in energy system choices. Our assessments (via remote oral presentations, online quizzes, electronic homework, and recorded videos) found that students, regardless of discipline, met course learning objectives despite the limitations of a remote format. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",,"Climate change; Curricula; Economic and social effects; Energy conversion; Engineering education; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Planning; Professional aspects; Surveys; Sustainable development; 'current; 20th century; Alternative energy; Architecture and engineering; Cooper Union; Energy conversion technologies; Engineering curriculum; Global pollution; Interdisciplinary course; Undergraduate institutions; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

This study investigates four main aspects of students' perceptions toward a BIM application of Sustainable Design and construction, including: (1) to analyze the current trends and future developments of BIM and Sustainable Design; (2) to improve students' understanding of BIM and Sustainable Design; (3) to implement the design practice of BIM and Sustainable Design; and (4) to promote student competencies with adequate resources and have better preparation for their future careers in the construction industry. This study surveyed distinct levels of architecture and construction students. Adopting the student population from Kennesaw State University as the case study, this research initiated a questionnaire-based approach followed by statistical analysis. The research from the student perspective would address perceptions of Sustainable Design using BIM applications, how BIM impacted Sustainable Design, and how BIM tools affect students' learning of building systems in the context of Sustainability. Students expect to respond to survey data accurately and honestly during the entire process, based on their background and experiences with BIM, Sustainable Design, and construction performance.

The EOP framework was developed through a collaborative process that engaged hundreds of stakeholders from industry, government, and academia. The framework aligns with ABET Criterion 3 Student Outcomes and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The goal of the EOP framework is to help guide the curricular changes needed to ensure that every engineer has the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for sustainable engineering practice. The framework consists of 43 core outcomes centered around the concept of systems thinking. The framework is grouped into nine subcategories of systems thinking, communication and teamwork, environmental literacy, responsible business and economy, social responsibility, environmental impact measurement, materials choice, design, and critical thinking. The ABET Civil Engineering Program Criteria (CEPC) requires that students be able to “include principles of sustainability in design.” Furthermore, ABET Criterion 3 Student Outcomes includes several outcomes related to sustainability. For example, Outcome 4 requires students to be able to “consider… global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.” Villanova University was awarded a grant to pilot the EOP framework. To integrate the EOP framework as rapidly as possible a faculty workshop was developed. This workshop has been delivered twice to cohorts of eight faculty each during five half-day sessions. These faculty have addressed twenty outcomes and assessed seven. At the time of writing, EOP outcomes have been included and assessed in three courses: two required undergraduate courses and one graduate level course. Assignments, group projects, and exam questions were used to assess the achievement of selected EOP outcomes. This paper will present an introduction to the EOP framework, a summary of the approach taken to rapidly integrate the EOP framework throughout the curriculum, a description of how the EOP outcomes were included in and assessed in several civil engineering courses, and the next steps in EOP implementation in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department.

Sustainability is an important theme within literature, and industry increasingly demands designers and engineers to be equipped with the skills to effectively implement sustainability into NPD. Furthermore, the product design stage within NPD is suggested to impact up to 80% of the overall sustainability of a product [1], [2], [3] and designers have particularly been identified to aid in the sustainable NPD process. However, sustainability is a complex issue and is often divided into three main pillars [4], which is frequently defined as the “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” [5, p. 16] within literature. As sustainability and issues surrounding climate change become more present within academic literature and global news it is of high importance that designers and engineers are suitably equipped with sustainability knowledge and understand how to implement sustainability within their processes during NPD to ensure the development of sustainable products. It remains unclear how equipped undergraduates are on the topic of sustainability within NPD. To investigate this gap, a two-stage methodology was employed. Firstly, a literature review was conducted, focusing on the current status of undergraduate education of designers and engineers, investigating modules for evidence of sustainability education within these disciplines. Secondly, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 industry professionals, all of which currently implement sustainability within their process in NPD. The semi-structured interviews included several questions focused on the participants education, whether they were taught about sustainability and whether this aids them in sustainability implementation during NPD currently. This investigation has enabled an evaluation of the current status of sustainability education within design and engineering disciplines. Additionally, a conceptual framework has been developed to aid the implementation of sustainability into design and engineering undergraduate courses. Future research directions have also been outlined. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",,"Climate change; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Product design; Product development; Academic literature; Current status; Design engineers; Design stage; Future generations; Industrial designers; New product development; New product development process; Semi structured interviews; Sustainability education; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

This provides students the opportunity to apply the topics that they have learned in class in a real-world situation, complete with the constraints and uncertainties inherent in practice. Community-based learning (CBL), a combination of service learning and PBL, allows students to not only apply the material from a sustainability course, but also to do so in service of a community partner. This work presents an analysis of a multi-year effort in teaching a CBL course on the topic of industrial ecology and sustainability in a North American context. Knowledge probes are utilized to quantify student preparation for the course and confidence in knowledge gained during the course in a longitudinal manner. Meanwhile, evolving student reflection is utilized to assess the impact of how the CBL element of the course influenced student thinking about the role of sustainability and industrial ecology within engineering education.

Employees are looking for next-generation employees with ever more skills. To ideally foster these in engineering and prepare them for future challenges, the integration of education for sustainable development (ESD) with a linkage of technical and sustainability-oriented issues in the curriculum is essential. This paper takes up two points: Firstly, an analysis of the research landscape in Engineering Education Research (EER) on the topic of ""sustainability"" is undertaken. For this purpose, more than 3500 conference papers of EDUCON and FIE of the years 2014 to 2018 as well as 2021 (EDUCON only) are evaluated. The methodology of the analysis as well as the set of main and sub categories (among them ""sustainability"") will be presented at SEFI 2022. The results of the analysis of the research landscape show that the topic of sustainability has so far played a negligible role in the conference contributions. Secondly, the focus is on the implementation process and the linking of technical and sustainability-oriented issues.

Specifically, in teaching the principles of Finite Element Analysis, used to perform engineering and performance analysis of designs, we introduce several real-world engineering ethics situations closely connected to the technical topics taught in the class. In taking up each case, the instructor provides a context, and the underlying micro-ethics and macro-ethics dilemmas are outlined. Students in two different cohorts are given the same problems. In the first cohort, the students submit an individual commentary following an analysis and selfreflection. In the second cohort, the students prepare a commentary in groups following a detailed deliberation between the peers. From the analysis of the commentaries of the two cohorts, we found that students in the second cohort had more evolved and rich commentaries. This cohort demonstrated a more developed moral imagination, significantly stronger ethical reasoning skills due to the exchange of ideas and knowledge between their peers, and facilitation by the faculty member. We also found that these debates and discussions help students hone their negotiation, strategic planning, public speaking, and evidence-presenting skills. Students also learn to empathize with peers' views and opinions, honing their collaboration and teamwork abilities while arriving at a consensus on open-ended problems. © 2022 Tempus Publications.

The engineering education research (EER) community may benefit from the knowledge of how CT has been used in the field. Purpose: Aiming to provide a broad view of CT in EER, the following research questions guided the study: How has CT been applied in EER, and how does it contribute to addressing the challenges of classical engineering education? What are the different complexity engineering approaches, and how can they be integrated into the context of EER?. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted. The review process was divided into three stages: planning, conducting, and reporting. Fifty-eight journal articles and five book chapters were submitted to an iterative process of organization, categorization, analysis, and synthesis. Results: Complexity schools of thought were integrated into EER. The research was organized into thematic categories: epistemological and ontological perspectives; complex thinking and competences; pedagogical approaches; complexity, sustainability, and transdisciplinarity interdependence; engineering axiology; and systemic transformation of engineering education. For each category, main contributions were integrated, and gaps were identified. Different meanings of complexity engineering were discussed and related to complexity schools of thought. Conclusions: Defining the type of complexity approach used is essential to advance knowledge, as there are fundamental epistemological, ontological, and methodological differences. Thematic categories help future researchers position theoretical contributions and be precise about how their findings contribute to understanding complexity applications in EER. Overcoming the limits of classical engineering requires a paradigmatic discussion, and CT proves valuable for this. © 2021 American Society for Engineering Education.",,"Computational complexity; Engineering research; Iterative methods; Ontology; Analysis and synthesis; Background complexity; Complexity theory; Engineering education research; Engineering education research communities; Iterative process; Journal articles; Research questions; Review process; Systematic literature review; Engineering education",Article,"",Scopus

Today's engineers are prototyping solutions for future cities. Engineering education must meet this challenge, with students developing knowledge in their engineering field while addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Problem-based learning (PbL) is a valuable tool in engineering education, particularly for sustainable development. In PbL, students solve engineering problems by developing projects. For example, students in early courses can confront problems demanding low-tech solutions. The Federal Center for Engineering Education in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, offers short-term project experience (PbL) focusing on SDG in cities. For 48h, students tackle SDG problems from urban communities and are challenged to create low-cost solutions. In the end, they pitch their solutions to experts from NGOs, governments, and corporations. This article presents a short-term PbL approach for SDG supported by one case developed by the students and concludes with recommendations for a research program, aiming to understand the process and transform the projects into concrete, sustainable, social innovation actions applied to communities. © 2022 SEFI 2022 - 50th Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education, Proceedings.

A well-integrated debate can help students to improve their understanding of the subject, improve their critical thinking, increase the retention of the information gained, enhance communication and teamwork skills, promote their confidence and help them to better construct their ideas and thoughts in a logical and sound structure. It is well known that integrating this approach in an active learning environment will promote a student's engagement and motivation to learn. In this paper, the practice of integrating the debate on the climate change response pathways (Adaptation, Mitigation and Geoengineering) in a final year course taken by Mechanical Engineering students will be presented.

It is critical that sustainable development (SD) principles are adopted in full swing by one and all to minimize the use of non-renewable resources, reduce the overall environmental impact, improve socio-economic conditions and provide access to education, healthcare and justice for all. Realizing this need, United Nations General Assembly put forth 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030 for a more sustainable future. There has been a steady rise in interest from today’s youth and industry alike to adopt sustainability principles. Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) can empower today’s youth, especially engineers whose work impacts all walks of life, with the skills and values required to play a central role in steering the planet towards a sustainable and regenerative path.

Towards this need, we see an increase in efforts towards incorporating sustainability into engineering education and particularly in engineering design education. Despite this work, there remains the need to investigate the influence of these interventions on students' individual differences, especially their trait empathy and attitudes towards sustainability. Such an investigation.is important as these individual differences could influence students' ability to relate to sustainabilityfocused issues and act upon them. Consequently, our goal in this paper is to investigate this research gap by exploring the relationship between students' individual differences - specifically, their trait empathy and attitudes towards sustainability - and their reflections on a sustainable design workshop in relation to a semester-long design project. Towards this goal, We conducted an exploratory study with 40 first-year engineering students from a large public university in the northeastern United States. The main findings from this study indicate the positive impact of participating in the snstainable design workshop on students' attitudes and intentions towards sustainability in addition to their perceived positive experiences with the workshop. These findings could inform future efforts towards devising pedagogical interventions that encourage a sustainability-focused mindset among engineering students, through engineering design education. © 2022 Tempus Publications.

This article attempts to address this pedagogical challenge by developing a leaching and learning practice for knowledge creation and competence. To realize this practice, the notion of the intelligent building has been addressed within the sustainability domain by piloting systems thinking pedagogy that incorporates learning tasks like cases, design modules, projects and is facilitated by guidance, feedback, and critique. The process utilizes the University of Ottawa (uOttawa) campus buildings as a ""real-space sustainability lab"" for developing learning content and collecting data for engineering design projects as part of teaching four related undergraduate courses.

The need for a more holistic understanding of the societal impact of engineering has been highlighted by government, professional institutions and industry, and has strengthened calls for a widening of engineering curricula. Despite this, there is evidence to suggest that the higher education (HE) sector is not producing socially responsible engineering graduates. This study explores potential barriers to the development of socially responsible, culturally aware engineers. In so doing, it draws upon student feedback and reflections from a UK based engineering design course which makes use of the Engineers Without Borders UK Design for People Challenge, and which focuses on human centered, sustainable design. The findings are discussed in the context of theories of reasoned action and planned behaviour. It is argued that engineering culture and curriculum act to discourage alternative modes of thought which leave students powerless in their ability to enact meaningful change.

Furthermore, the natural connections that exist between sustainability and social justice provide an optimal opportunity to integrate both into curricula. We argue that engineering curricula ought to include sustainability and social justice so future engineers are trained to understand both societal and technical implications of their work, while acknowledging the challenges engineering faculty may face in conceptualizing social justice or social sustainability. We then highlight how new sustainable design rating systems, such as Envision and The Living Building Challenge, embed inclusion and social justice into their ratings and how these sustainability rating systems can help engineering faculty bring social justice into their classrooms in ways that meaningfully link to engineering content. Finally, we present two examples of how sustainability and social justice can be incorporated into the civil engineering curriculum through inclusive pedagogy and new curricula: (1) a semester-long effort to document, design, and improve the inclusive pedagogical practices in a first-year engineering course that included the theme of sustainability throughout much of the class meetings; and (2) a new assignment about the Envision rating system and the societal implications of rebuilding a major component of regional infrastructure.

Offering a large-scale, realistic and valuable design experience to students beginning to learn about engineering is challenging. In 2020 the Faculty of Engineering (University of Alberta) introduced a new first-year design course for 1200+ qualifying year students: Introduction to Engineering Design, Communication, and Profession. The course is founded on four principles: engineering design is a distinguishing and core feature of engineering practice and education, transdisciplinary engineering design has a common process, sustainability is a key societal goal and integral to engineering design, and the communication of the evaluated design proposition is a necessary step towards design implementation. The course objectives are to introduce first-year students to the transdisciplinary design process and demonstrate differences between the engineering and traditional science programs. The course design had four additional requirements: (1) meet the needs of all our programs; (2) be taught by instnictors from each of our disciplines (supporting transdisciplinarity and discipline ownership); (3) engage applied learning; (4) use the design process to solve a community-based problem. The course implementation was supported by two co-lead instructors, the continued involvement of a third design instructor (course co-creator), eight guest instructors (representing all Faculty programs and the provincial professional association), and ten teaching assistants from both engineering and industrial design programs. All course materials (lecture slides, online resources, project descriptions, assessments) were developed in advance. Even as we were implementing this new course, we were collecting midterm feedback, reflecting on and adjusting the course in real-time, and planning the next iteration using a continual improvement process. At the time of original submission, the aim of this paper was to provide insight into the course development, implementation and lessons learned through its delivery. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, many more challenges faced the instructional team; these are also detailed in this paper. © 2022 Tempus Publications.

Intended to familiarize engineering students with central theories and topics in the field of science and technology studies as well as sustainability and responsibility, the lecture creates a contrast to the highly technical engineering contents in these study programs. To increase the accessibility of these topics for students, a detailed teaching concept was developed by the authors which is reviewed in this paper. The paper proposes this approach for teaching sustainability and responsibility to engineering students in a large mandatory bachelor's course as well as raising awareness for their own responsibility while maintaining focus on the academic content of the lecture. The paper aims to answer the following research questions: How to teach sustainability and responsibility to engineering students in a large mandatory bachelor's course?

A significant focus of this grant is to develop and integrate inclusive curriculum for core civil engineering courses. All core civil engineering courses at the sophomore and junior level are a part of this initiative. Courses included statics, solid mechanics, civil engineering systems, surveying, structural analyses, steel design, fluid mechanics, water resources engineering, material science, civil engineering materials, geotechnical engineering, environmental engineering, sustainable civil and environmental engineering and transportation engineering. The NSFREDinitiative was integrated with our CEE goes Green efforts that were initiated in 2004. This initiative allowed the above mentioned courses to incorporate concepts and content on sustainability. Course content included strategies such as faculty training, presenting case studies, rewording course syllabi and problems, assigning team projects, developing extra credit projects. The success of this integration is measured via course evaluations, focus group responses and senior exit interviews. The early assessment data indicates that the strategies for revising course content is successful as the student responses are extremely positive for all courses across the border. Seventy five percent or more students responded favorably to the questions posed for the select courses except for statics, solid mechanics, civil engineering systems and transportation engineering. The courses for the structural engineering sequence (statics, solid mechanics, structural analyses, steel design and transportation engineering) indicated lower scores in comparison to the environmental and water resources engineering courses.

This article addresses the non-technical skills that engineers need in order to make the best long-term choices for public safety while navigating organisational complexity. Previous contributions on engineering education reflect a strong focus on technical competence. Situated in the emerging conversations among education scholars on professional capabilities, we identify the holistic attributes and skills that empower engineers to make the best decisions for safety in uncertain, dynamic situations. Drawing on interviews with 41 engineers in the gas pipeline sector, the analysis develops a framework of individual capabilities for public safety decision-making consisting of 20 core elements. We see these 20 capabilities as falling into six categories: (a) use long-term, foresighted reasoning, especially in the face of uncertainty, (b) understand norms and values that inform actions, (c) think systematically and understand interconnectedness, (d) collaborate with and draw on the experience of others, (e) ground decisions in reality and (f) advocate for action and take responsibility. This capability framework has resonance with comparable work done in the field of sustainability education and extends the safety literature on non-technical skills into a domain where latent errors, rather than active errors, predominate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Engineering capabilities; Latent failures; Lifelong learning; Safety capabilities; Safety education","Decision making; Engineers; Errors; Safety engineering; Active errors; Engineering capability; Key topics; Latent failures; Life long learning; Non-technical skills; Public safety; Safety capability; Safety education; Uncertain dynamics; Engineering education; article; conversation; decision making; drawing; human; human experiment; interview; lifelong learning; pipeline; reasoning; responsibility; skill; uncertainty",Article,"",Scopus

Although most students at this institution participate in experiential learning, the framework aims to provide students with richer, more meaningful experiences through intentional engagement and reflection. Through several informal conversations, both students and employers have expressed the need for students to reflect and be able to better communicate the value of their experiences in relation to their technical skills and career aspirations. This point is reinforced by recent industry reports which emphasize the difficult time employers have in finding employees with the professional skills needed for the workplace. An objective of the experiential learning framework is to support reflection and competency development at scale, but the best model for this has yet to be identified. Indeed, it may be that multiple pathways (existing courses, new courses, online modules, etc.) will need to be available to students. Therefore, we piloted two new approaches for students to reflect and communicate their own competency development. The first is the creation of a new 400-level professional course that aims to develop students' understanding and communication of competency development via structured reflection. The second is a pre/post assessment of a faculty-identified set of competencies in an existing project-based, discipline-specific technical course. The new course takes a retrospective approach and asks students to leverage their experiences to create a set of stories that in turn highlight their values and guiding principles. Their final assignment was to develop a professional document, such as a personal statement, LinkedIn page, or resume, grounded in one or more competencies and informed by feedback from peers and alumni mentors. The pre/post assessment effort is a partnership with a faculty member leading a course on systems engineering and business leadership processes. The faculty member selected a subset of the key competencies (leadership, risk management, systems thinking, and teamwork) which aligned with course objectives. The pre/post assessment provides an opportunity for students to self-assess and reflect on their competency development over the course of the semester by focusing on their specific project. This paper will start with an overview of the experiential learning initiative and a description of the key competencies being used to guide reflection and communication efforts. Next, detailed descriptions will be provided for both the new course and the pre/post assessment effort including deidentified samples of student work. This will be followed by an initial assessment of student outcomes, a review of student feedback, and plans for modifying these efforts in the future. Finally, a description will be provided for how these efforts are also helping to inform the creation of a new online tool that will provide additional support for delivering content at scale to students around competency development, reflection, and communication. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",,"Curricula; Engineering education; Human resource management; Professional aspects; Risk management; Systems thinking; Teaching; Competency development; Experiential learning; Faculty members; Key competencies; Learning initiatives; Learning opportunity; Post assessment; Professional competencies; Risk management systems; System thinkings; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Systems thinking is useful in such cases but is rarely taught in engineering courses that do not explicitly include 'systems' or 'systems dynamics' in the syllabus. This work-in-progress describes an application of systems thinking concepts in an undergraduate and a graduate course in Agricultural Waste Management at North Carolina State University. Two specific systems thinking tools were introduced to help students appreciate the technical, economic, and social challenges related to implementing new animal manure management technologies in a production environment that already includes an established regulatory framework. The first tool was the concept map. The goal of the project was to explore the complex interactions of various stakeholders and agents of food animal production. Students in the undergraduate class were asked to create a concept map, in the form of a diagram, of the North Carolina swine industry with a focus on manure management and environmental impacts and protections. Each of the six students in the graduate class additionally created their map from the perspective of a different stakeholder group. Students also reviewed and provided feedback on the draft map from a second stakeholder perspective. Each student wrote a description of the system and map from their assigned stakeholder perspective. The second tool was the analysis canvas. The goal of the project was to identify system components that contribute to sustainable swine manure management in North Carolina and the changes in position, rules, regulations, and relationships among those components needed to facilitate sustainability. Two teams were formed in each class. In the graduate class the teams were formed so that all stakeholder perspectives from the first project were represented by students who had taken that perspective either as a primary or secondary role. Each team investigated a novel swine manure management technology that had previously been studied under the Smithfield Agreement yet had not been widely adopted at the time. Using the Product Archaeology Canvas, each team was tasked with describing what changes were needed to facilitate adoption of an advanced manure management system and the expected improvements in sustainability of the North Carolina swine industry. The teams also identified the critical issues for the stakeholders and the important compromises they would be asked to make for the system to work as described. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",,"Animals; Engineering education; Fertilizers; Human resource management; Manures; Sustainable development; Systems thinking; Waste management; Biological engineering; Class A; Concept maps; Engineering class; Management technologies; Manure management; North Carolina; Swine manure management; System thinkings; Technological challenges; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

As future leaders charged with developing and implementing solutions, it is critical that they be prepared to understand the complexity of the problem. Our Grand Challenges Freshman Seminar course uses a multidisciplinary approach to engage first-year engineering and humanities students in multidimensional critical thinking about climate change. Our teaching team consists of faculty members with expertise in environmental engineering, rhetoric, and policy. Our classes begin with student-led discussions of course readings and culminate in lectures with active-learning exercises. Our assignments are designed to encourage students to reflect on their individual impact on the environment, develop their capacity to read scientific papers, and understand the complexity and challenges of international climate negotiations. We believed these strategies would help students master technical content, see connections among the multiple disciplines related to climate change, and develop critical thinking, argumentation, and communication skills. To assess the efficacy of our strategies, we surveyed students at the end of the course using both quantitative and qualitative instruments. In these surveys students reported a statistically significant increase in their understanding of the interdisciplinary character of climate change. Further, the course received high satisfaction ratings and many students noted their intention to major in climate-relevant disciplines (e.g., environmental engineering, economics).. By sharing our pedagogical strategies and results in this paper, we hope to encourage colleagues to consider adopting this instructional framework as a strategy for inspiring students to become well-informed future leaders on this most pressing issue. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",,"Climate change; Curricula; Engineering education; Surveys; Teaching; Academic program; Climate change impact; Critical thinking; Faculty members; First year students; First-year engineering; Freshman seminar; Grand Challenge; Multi-disciplinary approach; Teaching teams; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

To address this need, case studies of damages caused by the natural disasters and a repository of information aimed to keep record and centralize information regarding relevant cases that provide examples of evidence of infrastructure damages and processes worth preserving is needed. To develop said case studies and a repository, a two-prong approach was used in this study. First, the case study methodology was followed. According to Yin, a case study is “an intense study of a single unit with the purpose of a larger class of (similar) units”. Case studies are used in academia for both research and teaching purposes. Our research team advocates for the use of case studies as tools to inform both learning and decision-making. Secondly, the repository model was developed. This paper presents the results of the development of the repository and includes sample case studies. The repository allows students, academics, researchers, and other stakeholders to understand the impact of extreme environmental conditions on the built environment. Faculty can use the repository in their courses to teach Architecture, Engineering and Construction students topics related to resiliency and sustainability in the build environment. Each case study developed and deposited in the repository, answers to research questions regarding what, how and when the damages happened, who were the stakeholders involved in the processes, what were their actions, and what are the lessons learned. The case studies have the potential of becoming responses to hypotheses for those mining the repository. The paper contributes to the body of knowledge by presenting the results of the development of case studies and a database that can be used for both research and teaching purposes.

The learning objectives of the course are 1) to introduce students to the engineering design process; 2) to practice applying the design process to solve problems in collaborative teams; 3) to learn the importance of effective communications; and 4) to feel confident in their capacity to be an engineer and identify as belonging to the engineering community. Typically, these learning objectives are assessed through a series of in-person design team projects in the classroom studio, whereby the instructor and teaching assistants work closely with students. In the Fall of 2020, however, the course will be conducted virtually. We discuss the design and implementation of a series of virtual design modules aimed at maintaining the course learning objectives while providing an inclusive and supportive learning environment. The design modules allow student teams to work remotely without the need for on-campus space or face-to-face time with the teaching team. Weekly virtual support was implemented through check-in hours held by each member of the teaching team, synchronous class discussions, educational videos available through VoiceThread, and the use of discussion boards and chat features. We also offered several ways to build community within the course, which was especially critical given the predominately online nature of this semester and the fact that the students were brand new to the University. Within each design module, students were given numerous opportunities to receive feedback on their work via homework assignments. The series of design modules included the following projects in the following order: 1. Design a ping pong ball launcher using household materials: As the first assignment of the semester, this project was designed to be fun, low-stakes, and easy to accomplish no matter where the students were learning. Teams made short videos describing their design and capturing five consecutive launches, including distance measurements. Videos were uploaded to VoiceThread so students could watch and learn from each other's designs. Teams worked in two phases: an initial design and a re-design, in order to reflect the iterative nature of engineering. 2. Propose ten redesign ideas of a simple device: This project offered teams the opportunity to practice the ideation process and to demonstrate the fact that multiple solutions can exist for open-ended problems. 3. Design a pandemic tool: Now that students felt comfortable working remotely and have gotten to know their teammates, the projects become progressively more complicated. In this project, teams practice problem definition and customer discovery, as well as technical drawing. The final deliverable was a 2-page technical report describing the problem, the customer profile, the rationale and details of the solution, and a summary of the potential impact and significance. 4. Pandemic-driven sustainability infographic and informational video: Here, students choose a sustainability topic of interest and explore how the pandemic has affected it, either positively or negatively. The students continue learning about problem definition and customer discovery, but also about new forms of communications, and the intersection of engineering/science and the general public. 5. Mathematical modeling of herd immunity: Here, teams learn the fundamentals of herd immunity and the role of vaccination, and how to create mathematical models to predict outbreaks. The final deliverable here is an OpEd piece in a fictional national newspaper sharing the team's findings and recommendations as a public health service. Again, the team will continue learning about problem definition and problem-solving, but with a focus on the use of computational and data science methodologies. Teams also continue to explore effective communications and the its employment for the public good. To assess the overall effectiveness of this approach on achieving the learning outcomes, a survey was administered at the beginning and end of the semester, focused on the students' self-perception on their comfort with fundamental engineering concepts and on their identification as an engineer and sense of belonging. The results of these surveys will be compared to assess any changes in these perceptions over the semester. Additionally, these results will be compared with course evaluations and general performance over time on the series of design modules. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",,"Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Design; E-learning; Engineering education; Teaching; Design module; Effective communication; Herd immunities; Introduction to engineering course; Learn+; Learning objectives; Learning outcome; Problem definition; Teaching teams; Virtual design; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Nonetheless, commonly adopted construction and civil engineering (CCE) pedagogy centers on traditional planning and vertical construction sustainability, neglecting the significance of FEP and SI. Nowadays most construction projects are required to meet sustainability goals, a trend that will continue to expand to all types of projects, whether they are vertical or horizontal, new construction, maintenance, or renovations. Therefore, it is critical to teach and encourage the future CCE workforce about the importance and application of FEP and SI tools, not only in residential or commercial construction, but also for infrastructure projects. The objective of this research paper is threefold: (1) to examine the efficacy of the applied PBL activity in terms of improving students' knowledge and ability to work with FEP and SI tools, (2) to assess the student's perspective on the convenience of coupling FEP and SI, and (3) to determine the student's level of interest towards FEP and SI within construction management (CM) curricula. To achieve these objectives, this research applied a Problem Based Learning (PBL) activity and assessed 45 undergraduate and graduate CM students at a Hispanic Serving Institution. The PBL activity enhanced students' knowledge on FEP for SI projects and could potentially provide an edge in their professional careers. The findings of the paper contribute to the engineering and construction education bodies of knowledge by paving the way for the future workforce to realize the criticality of constructing sustainable infrastructure projects and the importance of the FEP process in such complex projects. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","Front-end planning; Infrastructure education; Infrastructure management; Sustainability; Sustainable infrastructure","Employment; Engineering education; Project management; Students; Construction management; Front-end planning; Infrastructure education; Infrastructure managements; Infrastructure project; Infrastructure tools; Learning Activity; Problem based learning; Student knowledge; Sustainable infrastructure; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

These graduates have gone on to careers in a wide range of roles in a variety of industries. While the major requirements have evolved over time, the core principles of the program - articulated in the program's founding documents as “Society needs more liberally-educated persons with technical backgrounds” - have not. Thus, as the program celebrates its 50 years of educating sociotechnical citizens, and as society grapples with all-consuming sociotechnical problems - climate change, systemic racism, and pandemic spread and disruption - we are endeavoring to understand how our alumni see themselves and how their sociotechnical education has contributed to their identities and paths. In previous work, the authors have documented the history of the program, its current status, its core curriculum, and the impacts on students in terms of sociotechnical thinking and diversity. It is clear from this work that students approaching graduation do view themselves as sociotechnical thinkers. This analysis also shows that graduates are more diverse in terms of gender than those in other engineering programs on our campus, and more racially/ethnically diverse than both students in other engineering programs and students as a whole at our institution. This paper considers more deeply why the program is successful in developing sociotechnical thinking and in attracting such a diverse group of students to the major and classes. We are investigating alumni perspectives on their experiences in the program as undergraduates and how those experiences have shaped their thinking about themselves, their citizenship, and their careers.

Towards this end, several researchers and educators have proposed educational initiatives for integrating sustainable design in the engineering design curriculum, as early as in the first year of study. However, these initiatives are only as successful as students'ability to relate to the issues related to unsustainable behavior and take active measures towards these issues. Prior research has suggested the influence of empathy on designers'ability to relate to the users'needs. In the context of sustainable design, students must not only relate to the needs of the primary user but also empathize with those indirectly affected by their decisions. However, little research has explored the influence of students'trait empathy on the outcomes of sustainable design education and we aim to explore this research gap. Specifically, we introduced first-year engineering students to a two-day workshop on sustainable design approximately three-quarters of the way through their semester-long design project. At the end of the semester, students were asked to reflect on the utility of the workshop towards both, empathizing with the user, and designing sustainable solutions, in their semester-long projects. From our results, we see an increase in students'attitudes and intentions towards sustainability from before the workshop to the end of the semester. On the other hand, we see no differences in students'trait empathy. A qualitative analysis of students'reflections showed that students had a positive experience with the sustainability workshop and that they were more inclined to incorporate sustainable design practices into their project after participating in the workshop. These findings suggest the need for future work on the role of empathy development in encouraging a sustainable design mindset among engineering designers. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",,"Curricula; Ecodesign; Engineering education; Sustainable development; Design course; Design curricula; Engineering design; First year; First year design; First-year engineering; Primary Users; Research gaps; Sustainable design educations; User need; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Climate change looms large as an example of a social mess that engineers will need new capacities to effectively confront. The capacities engineers need include many attributes long discussed within the Liberal Education/Engineering and Society Division of ASEE and echoed in the NAE Engineer of 2020 report at the turn of this century: creativity, leadership, communication, lifelong learning, ethics, resiliency, and flexibility. There is increasing recognition that we additionally need to grow our capacity for holistic systems (or systems-of-systems) thinking, data-informed decision-making, transdisciplinarity and epistemic humility, critical understandings of power relations in organizations and society, and affective components of ethics, leadership and change agency, community-building, communications, and lifelong learning - all in addition to specific technological breakthroughs and enabling technologies to reconfigure essential sociotechnical systems.

In a senior-level Unit Operations and Process Simulation course for chemical engineers, students are asked to take a holistic approach to chemical plant design. However, previous iterations of this course did not ask students to consider the implications of building them: Who is making the decision to build these plants, and why are they doing so? Where are these chemical plants being built? Are they safe for the workers and the surrounding neighborhoods? Who gets to design these plants, and who will be maintaining these plants? If there's a difference between those groups, why? To this end, we incorporated a one-week course module on environmental justice as it pertains to chemical engineering. In an effort to emulate anti-racist, feminist modes of instruction, we called upon a few of the students to form a “cogen” (co-generative dialogue) to assist us in developing and delivering the course materials for this week of class. Over the course of the semester, four students self-selected to be a part of this cogen, meeting with the instructor once per week to co-develop learning objectives, instructional strategies, forms of assessment, and course materials for this module. In doing so, we centered the narratives of the students who have been directly impacted by climate injustice and environmental racism, as well as students who have been involved in climate activism in their non-academic lives, in the delivery of the course materials. Collaboratively, the 4-student, 1-instructor cogen team co-developed course content relating to the role of chemical engineers in advancing awareness of environmental injustice and its local, national, and global impacts on public health, economic security, racist violence, mental health, and more. By starting an in-class dialogue about the responsibilities of the members of our discipline, we hope to engage students in broader issues such as diversity, equity, and inclusion of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) individuals within STEM fields as well as the disparities in access to housing, healthcare, and education among marginalized communities across this country. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",,"Chemical plants; Curricula; Engineering education; Engineers; Collaborative approach; Course material; Environmental justice; Holistic approach; Operations simulation; Plant designs; Process simulations; Simulation course; Surrounding neighborhood; Workers'; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Recognizing the importance of sustainability analysis, many manufacturing industries are working to build an environment for practicing the concept of green design and LCA in product development and commercialization. To further strengthen the emerging interest, this paper describes the development of class project modules in the Industrial, Manufacturing, and Systems Engineering (IMSE) department at The University of Texas at El Paso. The primary focus of these modules is to introduce the student to the concept of green design and LCA in the evaluation of the environmental impact of the manufacturing process. This enables a high interdisciplinary platform for research and class modules suitable to be used in the academic environment for hands-on student training. The modules are developed by thoroughly analyzing the skillsets required by the industrial needs. The module includes: 1) Introduction and theory of sustainable design; 2) Product design and development using CAD software; 3) sustainability analysis of the 3-D soft product model; 4) introduction and theory of life cycle assessment; and 5) life cycle assessment using GaBi software. SolidWorks sustainability tool and GaBi software are incorporated as the working platform of the aforementioned four modules. The effectiveness of the project modules is investigated by integrating them as special topics in the summer, 2020 course and measuring the student outcome using a rigorous pre- and post-student survey. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","GaBi; Life cycle assessment; SolidWorks sustainability tool; Sustainability analysis","Binary alloys; Bismuth alloys; Computer aided design; Ecodesign; Education computing; Engineering education; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Manufacture; Product design; Students; Class projects; Commercialisation; Design life; Gabi softwares; Industrial manufacturing; Manufacturing industries; Product life cycles; Solidwork sustainability tool; SolidWorks; Sustainability analysis; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

National and international engineering bodies have recognized this problem and have articulated the need for sustainable engineering. This is creating an increasing social demand both nationally and globally to graduate engineers who have been trained to respond to the modern economic and environmental challenges. In a previous work at a large university in the Southwest, the authors developed an instrument to measure sustainable development literacy in incoming freshman engineering students. This work demonstrated a lack of understanding about sustainable engineering among the incoming freshman and led to the development of a module on sustainable engineering. The student engagement and interest in this module was measured, and these results have led to the design of a full semester long course titled Engineering for Sustainable Development for undergraduate students of all majors. The course took a modular approach in its development with each topical module having clearly defined and measurable outcomes with some independence. Responding to those demands for a more sustainable engineering practice, the course involves sustainable circular designs as core promoters of a circular economy. This innovative design thinking will create a new mentality in engineering students. In this paper, the authors present the process followed for the design, implementation and assessment of the course “Engineering for sustainable development” aimed to introduce and integrate sustainability engineering learning early in the engineering curriculum. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",,"Curricula; Engineering education; Planning; Students; Economic challenges; Environmental challenges; Freshman engineering students; Graduate engineers; International engineering; Student engagement; Students' interests; Sustainable engineering; Undergraduate Courses; Undergraduate students; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Research on teaching and learning these competencies is limited in engineering education. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study explores the impacts of a mindfulness training program on first-year engineering students and aims to understand potential impacts on the development of intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies. Design/Method: A four-session mindfulness-based program was designed, developed, and facilitated to cultivate intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies. Qualitative data were collected from a total of 35 students through a post-survey (n = 32), 3-month follow-up survey (n = 24), and interviews (n = 18). A thematic analysis process accompanied by validity and trustworthiness checks was employed to analyze the data. Results: The results suggest that the majority of students became more mindful, which led to improved intrapersonal competencies (e.g., self-regulation, focus, resilience, and well-being) and interpersonal competencies (e.g., empathy, communication, teamwork, and leadership). Discussion/Conclusions: The study provides compelling evidence that mindfulness training can support the development of intrapersonal and interpersonal competencies among engineering students, which can support their overall academic experience, personal, and professional development. Future design and development work will be needed to evaluate the integration and scalability potential of mindfulness training within engineering programs. © 2021 The Authors.

The infusion of sustainability and humanitarian engineering (HE) into the academic core curriculum is often challenging. This study aims to provide an understanding of students’ perceptions and attitudes toward the incorporation of active learning of sustainability and humanitarian concepts into engineering education. Design/methodology/approach: A project-based sustainability course was developed and offered to engineering undergraduates. A HE international field experience was also provided to students as an extracurricular activity. Pre- and post-surveys were conducted to assess students’ perceptions and attitudes toward sustainability and HE project learning experience. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the statistical significance of the results and demographic influences on students’ experiences. Findings: Both project-based and international field learning experiences positively influenced the students’ perceptions of sustainable practices, social change and appreciation of the engineering profession. Multidisciplinary learning also helped students become more motivated, engage in sustainability-promoted activities and community work and improve their social interactions. Students gained practical engineering skills that they did not typically receive in traditional classroom settings and recognized the global and social responsibilities that are core to sustainable development education. Originality/value: The study demonstrates a mixed undergraduate educational model in which students acquired sustainability concepts through a project-based engineering course and practiced social responsibility through international HE projects.

PURPOSE OR GOAL Our primary goal is to answer the question: How do interactions with emerging technologies support the development of mental models on sustainability topics? This question comprises two sub-questions along the lines of our conceptual framework grounded in constructionism and mental models for learning: How and in what ways do physical interactions with emerging technologies engage learners in learning about sustainability topics? How do the mental models developed as a result of such interactions impact learners' understanding of sustainability topics? APPROACH OR METHODOLOGY/METHODS We conducted a technology review, similar to a literature review, to understand the current state of the art in emerging learning technologies. Our review is informed by a conceptual framework comprising the learning theories of constructionism and mental models. Our current review is not limited to a particular age group. In the future, this work will inform technology and intervention design to support undergraduate engineering students in understanding sustainability issues such that they are cognizant of them in their engineering practice. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES This work has resulted in a synthesis of emerging learning technologies to learn topics of sustainability. The conceptual framework guiding the synthesis brings to light how hands-on constructionist learning experiences using emerging technologies can help support the development of mental models on an urgent topic of concern. This study also informs future work with undergraduate engineering students who make decisions throughout their careers with implications for sustainability. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY This work is a preliminary exploration of current learning experiences that use emerging technologies for sustainability education and will inform our future technology and intervention development work.

In response to these challenges, in this article we present a proposal for an undergraduate specialty in Society 5.0 for the School of Engineering at the University of Los Andes (Bogotá, Colombia). The specialty introduces students to the concept of Society 5.0 and provides essential and technical skills concerning selected technologies of the digital transformation age. The acquired knowledge is further applied to build prototypes for facing societal problems, and the proposed solutions are validated with respect to technical, ethical, and sustainability requirements. Given the deep social inequalities present in Colombia, and the increased ecological footprint in the country, we expect that the specialty increases the interest in the topic of Society 5.0, applies it in practice, and therefore contributes to the sustainable development of the country. © 2021 TEMPUS Publications.","Engineering education; Ethics; Multidisciplinary education; Society 5.0; Sustainability","Engineering education; Philosophical aspects; Sustainable development; Digital transformation; Ecological footprint; Engineering disciplines; School of engineering; Social inequalities; Societal problems; Student centred learning; Undergraduate engineering educations; Students",Article,"",Scopus

This renders mainstream educational discourses problematic, those that centre around the idea of preparing students for 'the future', defining competencies and standards. In this work, we write about critiques of contemporary education and alternative conceptions of education drawing on futures studies as well as sustainability education research. We understand learning as an emergent phenomenon and describe a conception of education that we refer to as emergentist education. We apply those theories to an open-ended group project course at an IT department at a large Swedish university. In the course, the students and the teachers develop, together with staff from an Academic Hospital in Sweden, healthcare with IT. In an action-research approach, we analyse written and oral reflections from the various actors involved in the course with the aim to understand the course, its value and challenges in new ways. Analysing the data through the lens of emergentist education theory, we discuss three themes: 1) forces on openness, 2) orientations to the future, and 3) emergent collaborative learning and novelty. We find that the educators take the role of maintaining openness, while the students demand a clear project definition. The future orientation turned out to be mostly about correcting and optimising the present. Yet, this project led to mutual learning and new paths being taken. Education can be a place for creativity and novelty, and an opportunity for learning through joint endeavours. © 2021 IEEE.","computing education; emergentist education; futures studies; higher education; project","Computation theory; Alternative conception; Computing education; Education research; Emergent phenomenon; Emergentist education; Future study; High educations; Open-Ended Group Projects; Project; Sustainability education; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: A new curriculum, “ethics, involvement and sustainability,” was designed and presented to engineering students from an undergraduate major in quality management engineering. This curriculum incorporated knowledge acquisition and skills training into sustainability via various teaching approaches in a mandatory curriculum at Tongling University, China. Pre- and post-questionnaire surveys, as well as a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model, were adopted to evaluate the changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of respondents before and after curriculum implementation. Findings: Significant changes in knowledge and attitudes were observed following the implementation of the curriculum. In terms of the development of new behaviors, the changes tended to be moderate. Generally, respondents were satisfied with the effectiveness of the new interdisciplinary curriculum post-implementation. Practical implications: Positive results were observed for the pilot and practice of the new engineering education (NEE) strategy at the cooperating university in China. Specifically, the integration of sustainability into curriculum design, implementation and evaluation inspired greater social responsibility in engineering students’ decision-making processes.

The hallmark of this transformation is the effect of digital technologies such as Internet of Things, Robotics, Cloud Computing, Additive Manufacturing, Artificial Intelligence and others on the way we make things and the way we do business. Unlike in earlier transformations, technological change is happening at an exponential rate; as a result, artifacts, knowledge, and expertise are becoming obsolete at a very fast rate. In this climate of exponential technological change as educators we need to ask hard questions, such as: Is the current system of engineering education appropriate for the current time? Are we behind our times by many decades? What should the new model of engineering education be? Should we have an Education 4.0 movement to go hand-in-hand with Industry 4.0? What would Education 4.0 look like? Naturally all of these are difficult questions to answer. We explore these questions critically and in the context of engineering education and discuss pockets of efforts that are underway in different corners of the education landscape to address these critical questions. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,"3D printers; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Industry 4.0; Critical questions; Digital technologies; Exponential rates; Fast rate; Hand in hands; Industrial revolutions; Technological change; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

In October 2018, the University of Puerto Rico received a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) collaborative award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop an integrated curriculum on resilient and sustainable infrastructure. The project titled Resilient Infrastructure and Sustainability Education-Undergraduate Program (RISE-UP) aims to educate future environmental designers and engineers to design and build a more resilient and sustainable infrastructure for Puerto Rico. This paper presents the design, initial implementation, and assessment of a curriculum encompassing synergistic interactions among these four domains: integrated project delivery, user-centered design, interdisciplinary problem-solving, and sustainability and resiliency. The project seeks to foster interdisciplinary problem-solving skills involving architects, engineers and construction managers, in order to better prepare them to face and provide solutions to minimize the impact of extreme natural environment events on infrastructure. The new curriculum stresses on problem-settings, the role that participants have on defining the characteristics of the problems that have to be solved, learning in action, reflecting on the process, and communication between the different stakeholders. This multisite and interdisciplinary program provides students with the necessary support, knowledge, and skills necessary to design and build resilient and sustainable infrastructure. This instructional endeavor consists of four courses designed to reduce gradually the difference between what students are able to accomplish with support structures and what students are able to accomplish on their own. To maximize and enhance the educational experience, the program blends a technology-infused classroom learning with broad co-curricular opportunities such as site visits, undergraduate research, and internships. As students advance in the program, they will be exposed and required to perform increasingly complex tasks. During the first year of the program, the following outcomes were achieved: 1) implementation of the faculty teamwork process to develop courses and analyze cases from an interdisciplinary perspective, 2) development and approval of an interdisciplinary curriculum on resilient and sustainable infrastructure, 3) development of case studies on situations associated with disaster and interdisciplinary responses, 4) development of a case study database, 5) establishment of an Advisory Board with government agency representatives and faculty, and 6) recruitment and enrollment of 30 students as the first RISE-UP cohort. In summary, the body of knowledge acquired from this project can serve as a model that can be replicated to develop and enhance academic programs at other institutions. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,"Curricula; Disasters; Education computing; Project management; Sustainable development; User centered design; Architecture engineering; Complex infrastructures; Integrated project deliveries; Interdisciplinary curriculum; Interdisciplinary programs; National Science Foundations; Sustainability education; Sustainable infrastructure; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

In an effort to educate future civil engineering graduates from the United States Coast Guard Academy (CGA) on the global impacts of climate change, an elective course, Coastal Resiliency was introduced into the curriculum. The objective of the course is to provide exposure to the impacts of climate change and foster a general understanding of the analytical and adaptation methods used to improve the resiliency of civil engineering infrastructure. The course is structured to foster student focused learning by engaging students to research key issues of climate science and engineering adaptation that promotes the development of information literacy skills. The interdisciplinary make-up of the students and term project requirements reinforce the development of teamwork, problem-solving, and communication skills. The use of a variety of learning techniques, and the infusion of global perspectives that includes how different regions of the world are addressing climate change and adaptation planning, has been particularly enriching to the student experience.

Resilience is related to construction as it is considered vital in the built environment. The research addresses wide-ranging definitions of resilience, encompassing endurance and adaptability, and seeks to understand how these definitions impact the learning experiences of students. The survey questions are used to determine how the students perceive natural disasters such as Avalanches, Landslides, Earthquakes, Floods, Hurricanes, Winter Storms, Sinkholes, Tornadoes, Tsunami, Volcanic eruptions, Tropical Storms, and Droughts. An online survey instrument was created to circulate among construction industry students to a) evaluate their experience of natural disasters, b) examine the source of knowledge of resilience on natural disasters, c) measure knowledge of post-disaster evacuation, and d) evaluate disaster preparation from university education. The study found that the population of the student body existed that had not experienced a natural disaster and were unaware of its impacts either on a personal or familial basis. Further, the majority of the responding students felt that their major(s) and universities did not prepare them in terms of handling natural disasters and extreme weather events.

Data were provided by the following: iterations of the FBC; oral and written peer feedback; and an online survey. Findings: Based on an evaluation of the experiment, this study shows that the FBC supports the use of multi-disciplinary, multi-national peer and distance learning in sustainability education. Research limitations/implications: This study used one test condition of multi-disciplinary, multi-national collaboration for peer and distance learning at one point in time. Additional tests, using the tools and approaches of this study, are needed.

A good level of geospatial thinking is related to academic success in engineering degrees. It is relevant, therefore, to detect the possible deficiencies that university students may have in tasks related to geospatial thinking. This research presents the results of a 2014-2019 multiyear study with agricultural engineering students, in which seven geospatial tasks were analyzed. The statistical analysis shows that geospatial tasks related to slope, stream/water flow, visibility, and relief interpretation are the best at predicting the final course mark. The present research provides quantitative data on the efficiency that four technologies have to reinforce geospatial thinking focused on each task. Augmented Reality is an appropriate 3D technology for geospatial tasks related to route search, stream/water flow, and elevation points. SketchUp Make 2017 and Autodesk 123D Make showed their potential to solve tasks related to terrain slope and visibility analysis.

The second study guided students to develop innovative projects for participating in the ""Internet Plus"" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition (IPIEC). To validate the proposed approach, stakeholder questionnaires and performance evaluations were implemented. The results show that the DBL approach was viable for sustainability competency teaching in terms of learning demand and teaching procedure. We found that students in the DBL group gave more prominence in the individual competencies, such as system-thinking, multidisciplinary applications, and collaboration.

The next generation of engineers has to be trained to appreciate economic, environmental, and societal impacts of its decisions, with an international perspective and at a local and global scale. The aim of this paper is to contribute to identifying the strengths and limits of current sustainability education practices to will be able to improve future decision-makers' and product designers' training. The first step of our research concerns the identification of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values associated with sustainability and ecodesign to highlight what kind of engineers' competencies for sustainability have to be trained. Based on this identification, we examine the French education system from secondary school to university to study sustainability and ecodesign integration in different technological French curricula and practices. The objective is to estimate the effective place of sustainable development and ecodesign in the technological training courses. We analyze programs and complete our approach by observing teachers in their classrooms or by conducting interviews. Even if concepts, knowledge and skills related to ecodesign appear in many different programs, our study emphasizes that there is not a continuum between pre-secondary school, high school, and university. As a consequence, teachers have difficulties to understand the aims and the coherence of the program, and students are not really comfortable with the issues of sustainability and ecodesign.

Our current model of development poses significant challenges when it comes to achieving a more just society based on respect for nature and human rights, and demands a sustainable economy supported by a new circular model supporting the UN sustainable development goals. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) accordingly have developed Master programs that are responsible for providing fundamental services in the joint effort towards sustainability. Meanwhile, leading Universities around the world have developed other very relevant programs. The open and unstructured challenge of sustainability poses an obstacle to existing academic structures. Specifically, the built environment is one of the leading contributors to challenges addressed in the programs such as: Anthropogenic climate change, resource depletion, waste generation and pollution, poverty, and inequity. The Interdisciplinary Sustainable Architecture lab (ISAlab) explores these issues as part of a multidisciplinary approach involving the collaboration of leading Universities from different areas on the world through an innovative initiative. This paper explores the experiences of the ISAlab workshop, which has been taking place yearly in Valencia since 2017. The workshop draws together students from a range of disciplines from across engineering and science, law and the social sciences and from a range of countries and backgrounds, including North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Its purpose is to facilitate a rich co-creative learning environment led by (engineering) academic faculties from across Europe (Spain, the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands and Ireland) as well as North America (the US and Canada), as well as local experts who helped provide participants with appropriate context and guidance. The objective is educating future engineers that are capable of finding robust ways to implement sustainability at a practical level on the built environment, taking account of the multidisciplinary perspective and with the incentive of solving real-life problems. © 2020 by the authors.","Multidisciplinary education; Project based learning; Sustainability education; Transdisciplinary education","academic research; anthropogenic effect; climate change; education; future prospect; human rights; learning; resource depletion; sustainability; sustainable development; United Nations; Asia; Canada; France; Germany; Ireland; Netherlands; North America; South America; United States; Valencia",Article,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This paper draws on the insights related to the development and implementation of the undergraduate program in Environmental and Urban Sustainability (EUS) at Ryerson University (Toronto). The conceptual framework of the program reflects the need for a broad foundation of sustainability education which spans disciplinary boundaries. EUS has blended new and existing teaching configurations, and has embraced both cross-disciplinary and disciplinary content and academic structures in its curriculum development and course offerings. The key to success has been the merging of existing course offerings from fourteen disciplinary areas as part of the core of the EUS program structure. Since the program operates concurrent with existing academic departments and schools (each of which has at least one of its own programs), developing cooperation and collaboration, while vital to program success, has been an enduring challenge.

Meanwhile, they developed educational materials, such as handouts, posters and papers, for outreach on sustainability with their biodiesel experience. A variety of educational activities were custom designed based on the knowledge level of the audience, including course incorporation, public outreach, mentored student research, and technology commercialization, etc. 16 STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) teachers from grades 7 to 12 learned to make biodiesel from waste cooking oil. They developed teaching modules using examples from this experience to enhance their STEM curriculum back in school. 21 undergraduate students have been trained to convert waste into usable products, together with Master and PhD students. Materials, operation procedures, best practice suggestions and videos have been developed for each type of activity for dissemination and record keeping. These, together with journal and conference publications, all have become training materials for others to follow. This module provides a very specific example of sustainable practices close to life, so that people's interests can overcome the fear of chemistry, especially for those without extensive chemistry training. This chapter can serve as an example on how to integrate sustainability in chemistry education, especially for non-chemistry majors.

Students work with professional mentors to develop solutions to relevant real-world issues. They are encouraged to develop innovative designs which meet all regulatory standards and design objectives. The Capstone coordinator works closely with the professional mentors to ensure that each design project meets ABET criteria as well as the ASCE Body of Knowledge (BOK). Recent changes to ABET criteria, and proposed changes to the ASCE BOK both focus on sustainability. They emphasize the need for students to gain an understanding of the impact engineering solutions have in global, economic, environmental and societal contexts. Students are required to understand the shifts in the global population and the increasing demands for energy, transportation, drinking water and the need for improved infrastructure. This paper focuses on how using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals along with the ASCE Envision Rating System will increase Civil Engineering undergraduate students' awareness of sustainability as they complete their capstone designs. The 13 design projects all focus on the design of infrastructure; vehicular and pedestrian bridges, mixed use multi story buildings, flood control projects and a hydro-power dam. Prior to beginning the design process, each student was required to evaluate the proposed design and plan to meet at least one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This resulted in each design team working to address at least one of these goals. These goals will be incorporated into the proposed design which will also consider the Envision rating system. Students expanded their focus beyond the design to consider the overall plan, construction, maintenance and life cycle of the project. The incorporation of both criteria helped to guide student decisions, evaluate the environmental impact of their designs and address the benefits the proposed design had on their respective communities. Students were encouraged to be creative and think outside of the box when developing their design solutions. Student surveys will be conducted throughout both semesters to assess student understanding of sustainability as it relates to their projects. These surveys will align with both the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Envision Rating system. The Envision Rating System will serve as a guide for the student teams as they develop their design solutions and improve the sustainability of the proposed design. The professional mentors working with the student teams will be asked to assess the applicability of the selected UN goals and the Envision Rating system to the proposed design. The impact of these two sustainability systems on the design will be examined with respect to the environment, societal benefit and economics. When applicable, comparisons will be made between the design developed by the student team and that proposed by the professional mentor. This comparison may provide added educational benefits as it will further illustrate the limitations of real-world design solutions. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019",,"Design; Engineering education; Environmental impact; Flood control; Footbridges; Hydroelectric power plants; Life cycle; Planning; Potable water; Professional aspects; River basin projects; Surveys; Sustainable development; Capstone design projects; Educational benefits; Engineering capstones; Engineering solutions; Engineering undergraduates; Flood control projects; Multistory building; Regulatory standards; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Solar, wind, and hydrogen fuel cell systems are available green energy technologies supported with customized educational trainers and modules in higher education institutions. Meanwhile other clean and alternative energy technologies such as geothermal heat pumps have steadily become an energy and cost efficient alternative to traditional heating and cooling systems. Geothermal energy is the energy contained as heat in the Earth's interior layer. The internal structure of the Earth together with the heat transfer mechanisms inside the mantle and crust plays a significant role in the geothermal energy applications. Geothermal energy, as natural steam and hot water, has been exploited for decades in order to generate electricity, and both in space heating and industrial processes in many countries. These require specifically engineering technology students to better gain competencies of geothermal energy for applying industrial, residential, and commercial geothermal systems in design, installation, testing, operating, data acquisition, monitoring and troubleshooting of related geothermal systems. However, due to larger laboratory space requirements, larger physical size, and the higher initial cost of geothermal energy applications, many engineering and technology institutions were not able to include them in the curriculum. Therefore simulation studies were the best option for students to understand geothermal heat pump design and operation. This paper describes the curriculum enhancement for an existing junior level alternative energy class in a B.S. in Engineering Technology program by adding geothermal energy fundamentals and industrial applications in it. The curriculum includes (1) the analysis of the refrigeration cycle on a pressure-enthalpy diagram using pressures and temperatures measured in a FESTO Didactic geothermal heat pump system, and (2) obtaining coefficient performance (COP) and the energy efficiency ratio (EER) of a geothermal heat pump using measured temperature, humidity, voltage, and current values in normal and different loading scenarios for safe and effective operation. National Instrument's (NI) LabVIEWTM software and myDAQ data acquisition module integrated with variety of sensors are also used as modern tools for the instrumentation and interfacing of the geothermal heat pump system that resulted in increased students' interest in traditionally mechanical engineering and technology application. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.",,"Application programs; Computer programming languages; Cooling systems; Cost engineering; Curricula; Data acquisition; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Engineering education; Fuel cells; Geothermal fields; Geothermal heating; Pumps; Refrigeration; Students; Alternative energy technologies; Engineering and technology; Engineering technology program; Engineering technology students; Green energy technologies; Higher education institutions; Pressure enthalpy diagram; Sustainability education; Geothermal heat pumps",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

In the manufacturing area, in particular, there is a discipline entitled Productive Systems whose main objective is to offer to the student a global vision about operations management. In the field of operations management, sustainability is gaining more and more importance; thus, it is important to develop in the students a critical sense about social and environmental aspects. Thus, this paper aims to present the main initiatives developed in the discipline to promote sustainability in engineering students. Design/methodology/approach: Since 2015, the professors responsible for the Productive Systems discipline, assisted by post-graduate students and professors from other universities, have begun to redesign the discipline, including debates, lectures, projects and other initiatives to provide a critical view concerning the traditional concepts taught. The discipline has been performed three times with this new conception. The methodology to structure this research was literature review, documental analyses of the discipline records and meetings with professors that participated in the initiatives. An Action Research approach was performed by two professors and a graduate student. The authors of this paper also compared the results with those obtained by initiatives performed at Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden). Findings: This study allowed to reinforce some results from initiatives performed at Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden); however, some differences were identified. For example, similar to the initiatives mentioned, the professors of University of Campinas had problems with didactic books, as they loosely integrate the basic operations management concepts with sustainable development fundamentals. On the other hand, debates related to social sustainability were considered positive from the point of view of the professors and students, differing from initiatives performed at Chalmers University of Technology. Research limitations/implications: Results come from one field study (University of Campinas) when professors of the Mechanical Engineering course try to integrate operations management concepts and sustainable development. Different results may be observed by other higher education institutions. Practical implications: The authors of this paper believe that the diffusion of these initiatives can stimulate other professors and researchers in the field to broaden the academic debate about the insertion of sustainability into engineering courses. Originality/value: There are few papers presenting didactic experiences and empirical results about the integration of operations management concepts and sustainable development.

Previous research suggests that engineering students are able to address WPs if they are given adequate support, but there is a lack of research on what kinds of support are needed. This paper aims to reduce this gap by reporting on students’ performance in, and approaches to, addressing WPs when different scaffolding strategies were used in different parts of a rubric-based intervention. The intervention aimed to provide undergraduate engineering students with an understanding of the nature of WPs and with a structured way of addressing them. For each part of the intervention, we discuss affordances for learning provided by the different scaffolding strategies. The results suggest that strong cognitive scaffolding can support students’ understanding of the nature of WPs and students’ performance in written responses to WPs, but possibly also limits deep engagement with WPs and transfer of learning to other contexts. © 2017, © 2017 SEFI.","assessment of learning outcomes; design-based research; engineering education; rubric; scaffolding; Wicked problems","Climate change; Engineering education; Engineering research; Scaffolds; Assessment of learning outcomes; Design-based research; rubric; scaffolding; Wicked problems; Students",Article,"",Scopus

In the research presented here, an educational framework is developed with an aim to improve student understanding of sustainable product design (PD) and manufacturing. The framework is founded on the analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate (ADDIE) model for instructional design. The developed framework is demonstrated using an example of a sustainable PD activity.

Autodesk's Building Performance Analysis (BPA) online modules were assigned in a sustainable construction class. Over the course of two semesters, students were required to complete tutorials and earn the BPA Certificate. Student feedback and assessments were collected after each module, as well as after final group presentations.

Until recently, however, discourses on ""empathy"" in engineering education are inspired primarily by ""empathic design,"" a concept that originated from market research and first gained popularity in the business world. This paper argues that the discourse of ""empathic design"" inadvertently advances an instrumentalist interpretation of empathy, one that ignores the depth and breadth of philosophical and psychological insights into empathy. The adoption of this instrumentalist, product-oriented conception of empathy exacerbates some persistent problems confronting engineering education, including a tendency to objectify the users of engineering products. Seeking to reconstruct empathy on the ground of philosophy and psychology literature, in this paper I begin to develop a genealogy of empathy in engineering education. The paper does this by tracing the discursive history of empathy in engineering education and in its discipline-based sub-communities (e.g., design and entrepreneurship). This genealogical survey also examines recent scholars' efforts toward redefining empathy as an engineering competency, which lays the groundwork for envisioning ""empathic engineering."" Champions of empathic engineering, taking advantage of knowledge developed in psychology and social work, link empathy to engineering students' moral development and communication skills. Ultimately, empathic engineering aims at advancing objectives related to community needs, sustainability, and social justice. I assess the implications of the discursive migration from ""empathic design"" to ""empathic engineering"" for the identity formation of the engineering profession. Furthermore, I argue that the movement toward ""empathic engineering"" suggests the potential for overcoming a narrowly-defined, instrumentalist, and product-oriented conception of empathy. As an example, I suggest two alternative conceptions of empathy in engineering: 1) empathy as a commitment to communicating and understanding across different cultural and epistemic communities; and 2) empathy as a professional excellence for engineers. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",,,Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Identity development is a social process realized through culture, through the interactions of students, faculty, and industry, through participation in engineering-related activities, and through reinforcement of shared similarities. The goal of this project is to develop a mechanical engineering program where students and faculty are immersed in a culture of doing engineering with practicing engineers that in turn fosters an identity of being an engineer. This culture of ""Engineering with Engineers"" is created through changes in four areas: shared vision, reflective faculty, relevant curriculum and pedagogy, and supportive policies. In each, a variety of actions create the cultural change, address barriers to change, and ensure sustainability. A common theme unifying these changes is a significant connection to industry. During this project, changes to the program and to student and faculty identities are monitored through interviews, surveys, and portfolios. Results of the study will lead to a clearer understanding of the changes that promote engineering identities and how such identities affect students' sense of belonging in a program and their persistence in the major. The study will also lead to a better understanding of the factors that influence faculty identity, and how these richer identities affect how they view their roles and their students. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",,,Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Recent literature on engineering ethics highlights the need to integrate social and environmental aspects of ethics into technical topics through culturally sensitive and community-oriented approaches. Purpose/Hypothesis: This paper explores the ethical reflections of U.S. doctoral engineering students after a two-week experience studying electronics manufacturing in India. This authentic experience is essentially a lived case study, where the students' roles were to listen and engage with a broad range of stakeholders affiliated with the electronics industry. Design/Method: This study used photoelicitation methods to elicit deep reflective interviews with the doctoral student participants, reporting the qualitative analysis of these interview transcripts. Results: The concept of sustainability is typically seen as comprising the individual dimensions of economic, social, and environmental facets; however, the narratives of ethics and sustainability emerging from the interview data reported here point to the importance of the intersections among these aspects. Themes relating to safety and regulations, gender roles, and resources and waste emerged as manifestations of these intersections. Conclusions: The graduate students demonstrated ethical reasoning skills related to regulations, gender roles, resources and waste, and their professional ethical responsibilities as they discussed the experiences of their trip. As students reflected on ethical tensions based on their experience, they demonstrated a deep commitment to engineering ethics, acknowledging their roles in fostering sustainability and committing to thinking about the distant stakeholders affected by engineering decisions. © 2018 ASEE","ethics; graduate education; photoelicitation; sustainability","Electronics industry; Engineering education; Philosophical aspects; Sustainable development; Engineering ethics; Environmental aspects; Ethical issues; Gender roles; Global context; Graduate education; Photoelicitation; Social and environmental; Sociotechnical; Student perspectives; Students",Article,"",Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: The selected approach to enrich engineering students with sustainability skills was active learning methodologies. First, a survey was carried out on a sample of 189 students to test the current sustainability literacy and determine the roadmap starting point. Next, a scientometric study regarding active learning methodologies was executed. A total of 2,885 articles and conference proceedings from the period 2013-2016 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. The records were then imported into text mining software to undergo a term clumping process. Annual knowledge clusters based on key terms were outputted. Finally, a roadmap was created by experts based on the annual knowledge clusters. Findings: Four annual pathways were created along the roadmap to develop sustainability skills during the four-year college course in engineering. The first consisted on promoting a recycling campaign through a circular economy. The second aimed at creating educational videos regarding sustainability. The third reinforced reasoning and argumentative skills by preparing a debate on environmental issues. The last path assumed that the student is working in internship programs and prepared him/her to apply environmental management models to solve sustainability issues within the company. Research limitations/implications: Roadmaps should be updated approximately every two years to reflect novelty. The proposed methodology shows an easy way to create them. Practical implications: Results from this paper, as well as the proposed methodology, can be applied to any organization forming individuals: from primary school education to employee training programs in organizations. Social implications: The development of sustainability skills has a direct, positive impact on professional decision-making and, ultimately, on the environment. Originality/value: This paper presents a roadmapping process to develop sustainability competences throughout engineering college education. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Active learning; Engineering students; Higher education; Innovation pathways; Roadmap; Survey; Sustainability; Text mining",,Article,"",Scopus

The purpose of this research is to establish the impact of the SusMet module on student cognition and perceptions of sustainability and to understand the effect of activity on learning objective retention. The SusMet Module was implemented in a total of nine courses (318 total participants): eight freshman Introduction to Engineering and one junior Engineering Projects in Community Service course at Arizona State University. Research design included one course where students completed the entire module and one comparison course where the activity was removed; both courses included a follow-on design assignment two weeks after module implementation. The module was assessed using the mixed-methods approach of anonymous, digital pre- and postmodule surveys and a rubric to test the impact of activity on learning objective retention. The activity had the greatest impact on student cognition and retention of learning objectives; students that experienced hands-on disassembly of the chairs retained concepts students tended to struggle with, i.e., design for end-of-life (explicit) and sustainable metrics (implicit), to a greater degree than students in the Intro-Act+Ret course that did not experience hands-on chair disassembly.

Annually it consumes approximately 22,000 metric tons of organic waste, predominantly food waste from the MSU cafeteria system and animal excrements from the MSU farms, and turns them into biogas and digestate. The digestate is a high quality organic fertilizer and replaces chemically produced fertilizers for MSUâ€™s farm fields, which saves money at the same time that it conserves valuable resources. The biogas is combusted in high efficiency reciprocating engines and produces a constant electric power of 300â€“500Â kW. The digester facility also serves as a living classroom for a wide variety of student groups: it hosts thesis projects for graduate students and senior undergraduate students in bio-systems engineering and other engineering and agriculture disciplines, it serves as a laboratory for regularly scheduled undergraduate classes, and it is a popular destination for K-12 school field trips.

Knowledge has been identified as a key driving force for innovation usually resulting in intellectual property as a reward for creativity. Engineers of today are expected to possess abilities for teamwork, creativity, and innovation in order to meet the challenges and complexities of the 21st century. However, there is insufficient empirical evidence explaining the organizational, social and cognitive processes affecting innovation among engineering student design teams—the engineers of tomorrow. The research addresses the question: What are the factors affecting Innovation in engineering student design teams? The study advances a framework for engineering student team innovation and uses survey data from a representative ABET accredited four-year institution of higher learning involving 709 participants constituting 210 design teams from 40 design sections across nine academic departments at a college of engineering during an academic year. Validity and reliability of the survey instrument were obtained by using pre-existing scales, a pilot test, factor analyses, and scale reliability analysis. Other analyses involved aggregation analysis, ANOVA, correlation, and hierarchical linear modeling. A validated 59-item survey scale was realized. Perceived engineering student team innovation is found to be significantly related to leadership, support for innovation, rewards, team size, communication, task orientation, effort, learning, cohesion, conflict and participative safety at the team level. Most study findings agree with general organization team innovation literature with exceptions of participative safety and support for innovation. Findings from the study have implications for the improvement of engineering design curriculum and provide a framework for endeavors to harness skills for teamwork and innovation among engineering graduates through enhancing or regulating the determinants of innovation.

The objective of the project is to establish a framework to facilitate the training of graduates capable of leading the resolution of challenges in our society through the integration of sustainability training in the Spanish University System. For the training of graduates, it is essential to train teachers beforehand, since most of them do not possess competencies in sustainability. The EDINSOST project involves fifty-five researchers from ten Spanish Universities. It encompasses five engineering degrees and three degrees related to the three dimensions of sustainability, given their great impact on the short-term challenges confronting society. In view of its multiplier and long-term effect, the project also includes the Bachelor and Master’s degrees of five Education degrees, because graduates from these courses will be the future teachers of new generations of citizens. To achieve its objectives, the project has defined a sustainability competency map for thirteen degrees in the fields of education and engineering. On the basis of this map, the most appropriate didactic strategies for sustainability training will be established, the state of the sustainability training requirements in teachers and students will be diagnosed, and finally, proposals will be made for training both groups. In this paper, the objectives of the EDINSOST project are presented, as well as some results of the first objective: the sustainability competency map for engineering degrees.

To date, most education research on climate change examines middle and high school students' knowledge without considering the link between understanding and interest to address such issues in their career. In research on students' attitudes about sustainability, we found that half of first-year college engineering students, in our nationally representative sample of all college students at 4-year institutions (n = 937), do not believe climate change is caused by humans. This lack of belief in human-caused climate change is a significant problem in engineering education because our results also indicate engineering students who do not believe in human caused climate change are less likely to want to address climate change in their careers. This dismal finding highlights a need for improving student understanding and attitudes toward climate change in order to produce engineers prepared and interested in solving complex global problems in sustainability. To advance understanding about students' understanding of climate change and their agency to address the issue, we developed the CLIMATE survey to measure senior undergraduate engineering students' Climate change literacy, engineering identity, career motivations, and agency through engineering. The survey was designed for students in their final senior design, or capstone course, just prior to entering the workforce. We developed the survey using prior national surveys and newly written questions categorized into six sections: (1) career goals and motivation, (2) college experiences, (3) agency, (4) climate literacy, (5) people and the planet, and (6) demographic information. We conducted focus groups with students to establish face and content validity of the survey. We collected pilot data with 200 engineering students in upper-level engineering courses to provide validity evidence for the use of these survey items to measure students and track changes across the undergraduate curriculum for our future work. In this paper, we narrate the development of the survey supported by literature and outline the next step for further validation and distribution on a national scale. Our intent is to receive feedback and input about the questions being asked and the CLIMATE instrument. Our objective is to share the nationally representative non-identifiable responses (the estimated goal is 4,000 responses) openly with education researchers interested in students understanding about climate change, their engineering identity, career motivations, and agency through engineering. Ultimately, we want this research to become a catalyst for teaching about topics related to climate change in engineering and its implications for sustainability. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,"Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Engineering research; Motivation; Professional aspects; Students; Surveys; Sustainable development; Teaching; Demographic information; Education research; Engineering course; High school students; Representative sample; Survey development; Undergraduate curricula; Undergraduate engineering students; Climate change",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Freely available modular lessons are one way to quickly effect this incorporation. This research examines the effectiveness of a class format using short prerecorded software modules on lifecycle assessment (LCA) in the classroom setting with associated discussion, primarily drawing from student perspectives in a graduate-level LCA course at Washington State University. Survey results indicated that students generally agreed that the in-class module-discussion format was an effective teaching method. Advantages included that the format was organized and complete, but still concise, allowed for review of material outside of class, and that discussion components furthered understanding and stimulated further thought about the concepts. Key disadvantages included that the modules can get boring, were sometimes too fast-paced, and that questions usually were held until the end of the presentation. Students were happy with the length of modules (about 20 min each), but many expressed a desire for additional discussion time. Recommendations for future versions of the course include taking additional breaks during modules for discussion, encouraging students to ask questions at any time, and suggesting that some students print slides to stay engaged with note taking. In the future it is anticipated that these types of narrated modules will make it easier for other instructors to provide more sustainability education in their classrooms. © 2016 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.",,"Education; Life cycle; Surveys; Sustainable development; Teaching; Classroom settings; Effective teaching methods; Graduate levels; Life-cycle assessments; Software modules; Student perspectives; Sustainability education; Washington State University; Students",Article,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus

This paper presents the development of a sustainability rubric and application of the rubric to civil engineering senior design capstone projects to evaluate students' sustainability knowledge at two institutions. The rubric built upon previous assessment approaches to evaluate student reports for nine different factors including dimensions of sustainability, Bloom's taxonomy, sustainability links, drivers for including sustainability, location of sustainability within report, qualitative/quantitative incorporation, sustainability source/reference, and sustainability topics. The sustainability content within Spring 2014, Fall 2014, and Spring 2015 senior design capstone projects from university A (UA, n = 181 students, np = 28 projects) and university B (UB, n = 106 students, np = 15 projects) was evaluated using a mixed-methods approach. The mixed-methods assessment included observation of student project presentations and evaluation of student reports via rubric. Rubric evaluation of student reports revealed that students' performance in senior design projects is primarily driven by their instructor's expectations; if sustainability is not a major deliverable, then students are less likely to integrate sustainability concepts that they learned from prior classes in their reports. To make sustainability a priority, senior design project requirements should be updated to explicitly require holistic sustainability applications. Instructors could approach raising sustainability expectations by engaging a sustainability expert as an advisor to the senior design course and/or utilizing a sustainability expert as project mentor, as demonstrated in the success of one senior design project at each institution during this study.","Capstone design; Mixed methods; Sustainability","Curricula; Engineering education; Students; Capstone design; Civil engineering curricula; Engineering curriculum; Holistic sustainability; Integrate sustainability; Mixed method; Sustainability education; Sustainability knowledge; Sustainable development",Article,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

The framework that we present here is the Sustainability of Technical Education (SoTE), where sustainability is defined as the ability to continuously improve without reducing the capacity to endure. The SoTE consists of criteria, measures, indicators, and a set ofaligned analytic rubrics that aid the calculation of different indicators includinga one main indicator called the Sustainability Indicator.

While untreated and treated rainwater is used for a number of purposes ranging from garden irrigation to toilet flushing, a more extensive use of rainwater resources is currently hindered by the lack of uniform regulations. Considering that many regions suffer from droughts and that water scarcity is becoming one of the main environmental issues in the United States, a change in regulations, as well as in sustainable water design practices, is needed. University of Washington's (UW) Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) department is aiming to facilitate this change by educating a new generation of engineers to become familiar with the economic and ecological advantages of rainwater harvesting, know how to design and operate rainwater treatment systems and have a holistic understanding of sustainable water management practices in urban areas. In spring 2015, the UW Campus Sustainability Fund (CSF) grant awarded the construction of a rainwater collection and purification system in and adjacent to the construction materials laboratory space in the CEE department. The goal of the project was to provide the laboratory with a supplementary source of water for various uses, and serve as a campus wide educational tool for innovative, sustainable water management practices. The student-designed and built rainwater collection & purification system was brought online in March 2017. This presentation summarizes the lessons learned from implementing the interdisciplinary student project and discusses the experience from both students' and project lead's perspective. © CSCE-CRC International Construction Specialty Conference 2017 - Held as Part of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference and General Meeting 2017.All rights reserved.",,"Environmental regulations; Purification; Students; Technology transfer; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Campus sustainability; Environmental issues; Interdisciplinary student projects; Rain water harvesting; Rainwater collections; Sustainability education; Sustainable water management; University of Washington; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Engineering education needs to revise and change its curriculum to integrate ESD principles and knowledge. Problem based learning (PBL) has been one of the main learning pedagogies used to integrate sustainability in engineering education. However, there is a lack of understanding of the relation between ESD and PBL principles and the ways in which they can be integrated and practised in the engineering curricula. This paper aims to investigate the relation between PBL and ESD and the ways in which they are integrated and practised in the engineering curricula. Design/methodology/approach: The study starts with a review of the literature concerning ESD and PBL theories where relations between both are defined. The literature review is followed by an empirical work in which the PBL and ESD relations are investigated in relation to the PBL engineering curricula. The empirical work involves two engineering master programmes from Aalborg University, Denmark, while documentary analysis and interviews are used as methods for data collection. Findings: The results show that even though PBL and ESD share common learning principles, their practice presents limitations that challenge the full integration of sustainability, namely, the crowded, strict and academic-centred curriculum, the struggle to balance different contexts with professional, interdisciplinary and collaborative knowledge and the tacit presence of sustainability. Originality/value: The existence of a PBL curriculum at institutional level, such as at Aalborg University, enables investigation of how the PBL and ESD principles are practised, highlighting the limitations and potentials of integrating sustainability in the engineering curriculum. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Curriculum change; Education for sustainable development; Engineering education; Learning principles and competencies; Problem based learning",,Article,"",Scopus

Macroethics refers to the broader ethical obligations of the profession such as those embodied by social responsibility and sustainability. The extent to which students graduate with an understanding of macroethical issues is unclear and in need of organization. The goal of this new research project is to evaluate the various ways in which macroethics is taught in engineering, examining variations in pedagogy and topics, as well as examining differences between disciplines and institution types. This paper describes the first phase of the research, to develop surveys that will reveal a national picture of engineering macroethics instruction. Survey development began based on a review of the literature. One survey was targeted to deans and department chairs, aimed at identifying the names of faculty at their institutions who are involved in ethics instruction. A second survey was aimed at faculty who teach macroethical topics in courses for engineering students. A third survey was aimed at faculty who mentor co-curricular activities where students may learn about or engage with macroethical issues. Pilot versions of the three surveys were distributed to selected faculty at three institutions: a large public research-intensive university, a private research-intensive university, and a Christian-affiliated, private Baccalaureate university. Approximately 30 responses indicated a breadth of courses where faculty infused a wide variety of macroethical topics. It also revealed the challenges associated with encouraging faculty to respond to surveys. A handful of faculty participated in follow-up interviews, giving feedback to help improve the surveys. The surveys were revised, with national dissemination in spring 2016. The dissemination plan includes ASEE list serves and a targeted list of individuals who have publications and have received grants related to macroethics education.

The framework attempts to respond to requests collected from 17 professionals and professors in order to integrate BIM into the higher education curriculum in China with a specific focus on construction management programs accredited by the American Council for Construction Education (ACCE). The entropy method and a K1-K6 scale adapted from Bloom's revised cognitive process were employed to evaluate the CEM curriculum in QFD. The proposed framework was successfully applied to CEM curriculum planning, which included two curriculums of the four main knowledge areas provided by the Chinese CEM guidelines: construction cost and flow construction. Two curriculum areas showed that content should focus on knowledge such as (a) Program evaluation and review technique(PERT) planning; (b) construction optimization in flow construction; (c) principles of bill of quantities and (d) construction consumption in construction costs. As for teaching quality management in China, the higher education curriculum should focus on three aspects to promote curriculum integration: (a) pedagogical design; (b) teaching resource and material and (c) curriculum assessment.

The research applied methodology involved mixed method action research philosophies, sustainability design tools (such as life cycle analysis), participatory and ethnographic exploration of education in the context of Front Range of Colorado, particularly with respect to socioeconomically challenged urban areas, described as two interacting vignettes. Simultaneously, challenges to the applied methodology as action research are framed. It was concluded that action to create more rigorous sustainability education and leadership outcomes is possible given development by mixed frameworks (e.g., via logic models) that can align with larger strategic efforts (e.g., United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization's Global Action Programme).

The training techniques (online, blended and face-to-face seminars, and Coaching processes) and the outcome research methods (ad-hoc surveys and tests, pre-post evaluation using Emotional Intelligence evaluation tests) used in the five-year project are presented in this manuscript, as well as the results obtained from the 451 students and 135 professors from six engineering schools of the UPM who enrolled in the project. The benefits of these projects (a significant increase in the students' emotional quotient and in the professors' emotional skills have been achieved) and the sustainability of their activities (an emotional competencies development online classroom, accessible to the entire university community, has been launched) are highly encouraging. © 2016 TEMPUS Publications.","Coaching; Emotional competencies; Emotional intelligence; Transversal competencies","Competition; Education; Personnel training; Teaching; Emotional intelligence; Engineering education; Social psychology; Academic achievements; Coaching; Educational innovations; Emotional competencies; Emotional intelligence; European Higher Education Area; Technical universities; Transversal competencies; Emotional competency; Innovation programs; Personal development; Transversal competency; Students",Article,"",Scopus

The Learning Enhanced Watershed Assessment System (LEWAS) and the Online Watershed Learning System (OWLS) provide data creation and data sharing infrastructures, respectively, that combine to form an environmental learning tool. This system collects, integrates and stores real-time, high-frequency environmental monitoring data and imagery from a small urbanized watershed and makes it available to users at anytime from anywhere they have internet access. This paper discusses both the developmental and maintenance challenges associated with the LEWAS and the design details of the OWLS. A pilot test of the OWLS was implemented in a senior level hydrology course as a part of an NSF funded project. Results indicate that 80% of students (n = 30) valued the anywhere, anytime access to the data and 97% of students believed that access to the OWLS helped them to learn hydrologic concepts. A similar pilot test implemented in a community college freshman engineering course as part of the same project indicates that students (n=27) who used the OWLS felt that the OWLS assignment was valuable and relevant to their coursework even when their academic performance was underwhelming (40% correct on multiple choice questions). Future plans to expand the scope of the LEWAS-OWLS to cover environmental data from other geographical regions are discussed.","Online learning systems; Real-time monitoring operational challenges; Water sustainability education","Birds; E-learning; Education; Geographical regions; Learning systems; Monitoring; Online systems; Real time systems; Sustainable development; Teaching; Watersheds; Classroom implementation; Data sharing infrastructure; Environmental Monitoring; Freshman engineering course; Multiple choice questions; On-line learning systems; Operational challenges; Water sustainability; Students",Article,"",Scopus

Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured interviews were conducted with programme leaders and teachers from four engineering programmes. The paper focuses on how the concept of social sustainability is defined and operationalised in the selected engineering programmes, how social sustainability is integrated and taught, and what resources are required to support teachers and programme leaders as social sustainability educators. Findings – The findings show that programme leaders and teachers at KTH struggle to understand the concept of social sustainability. The vague and value-laden nature of the concept is considered a challenge when operationalising educational policy goals on social sustainability into effective learning outcomes and activities. A consequence is that the responsibility for lesson content ultimately falls on the individual teacher. Study visits and role-play are seen as the most effective tools when integrating social sustainability into the engineering curriculum. Allocation of specific resources including supplementary sustainability training for teachers and economic incentives are considered crucial to successful integration of social sustainability. The findings indicate that social sustainability education needs to be built on a theoretical foundation. It is therefore suggested that a literature canon be established that clarifies the contours of social sustainability. Practical implications – The findings of the paper can be used as a basis for discussion regarding measures for improving social sustainability training in engineering education, a subject which has attracted relatively little attention, to date. Originality/value – There is a noticeable lack of empirical research on how technical universities integrate social sustainability into engineering education. The paper provides an account of how actors directly involved in this work – programme leaders and teachers – define and operationalise the social dimension of sustainable development in their engineering curricula, the pedagogical tools they consider effective when teaching social sustainability issues to engineering students, and the resources they believe are needed to strengthen those efforts. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Curriculum design; Engineering education; Integration; Social sustainability; Sustainable development",,Article,"",Scopus

Thus, teaching future engineers to think sustainably requires a multifaceted, multipronged approach. To that end, a team of faculty from the Departments of Civil, Industrial, and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington acquired funding from the National Science Foundation to implement a project entitled ""Engineering Sustainable Engineers."" The project was designed to infuse undergraduate curricula in the three departments with sustainability, which was augmented by incorporating sustainability emphasis into other aspects of the undergraduate experience. Key program elements were (1) learning modules developed for courses across all levels of matriculation within the three curricula, (2) quality sustainable internships, and (3) a multidisciplinary senior design project with a sustainability focus.

Many of the most pressing issues, such as climate change, resource scarcity, and pollution, require holistic approaches that go beyond technical systems analysis and optimization. Such problems have been called wicked sustainability problems (WSPs) because they are highly complex, contested, and lack definite solutions1,2. Engineering education has the potential to play an important role in preparing students to contribute to deal with problems such as WSPs3,4. To be able to contribute in this way, students need to develop an ability to holistically and integratively understand and address WSPs while considering the normative context of sustainable development (here called WSP literacy). However, common practice in engineering education more commonly prepares students to address well-structured and tame rather than wicked problems5,6. One reason may be that working together to develop complex competencies such as WSP literacy is challenging for students as well as educators. Wiek, Withycombe, and Redman suggest that formulating and operationalizing intended learning outcomes (ILOs) for complex competencies can facilitate this difficult process and thus improve engineering education practice4. In this paper, we provide a preliminary matrix of 22 concrete ILOs for WSP literacy, as well as two different approaches to assessing (some of) them in engineering education. We expect that engineering educators will find these ILOs and assessment strategies valuable for adopting a constructive alignment approach for WSP literacy in their teaching. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.",,,Conference Paper,"",Scopus

In this paper, the authors provide the associated course development principles grounded in problem-based-learning (PBL) and service-learning (SL) pedagogies, course management strategy, as well as the educational and learning philosophies. To this end, the course PBL activities utilized interrelated and mutually supportive assignments and projects where the assigned problems were not created equally (i.e., varying in complexity and structuredness). Through the evolution of problem-based course activities, the students were engaged in a service-based assignment in relation to the LEED certification process for a new on-campus building. Also, the associated student work was shared with the project developers for potential usage, and resulted in a peer-reviewed journal paper that is forthcoming in the Journal of Management in Engineering. The results and analysis associated with this study were comprised of PBL activity characterization, instructor evaluation of student performance, and student self-reflections of the course. The results suggest that even with increased complexity of PBL activities, students' performance increased throughout the semester. Although arriving with some resistance, students ultimately took ownership of the entire educational experience and completed a final open-ended, complex, and authentic service learning activity. Through engaging students in discussions and guiding their reflections on scientific material, instructors are regarded as facilitators and collaborators rather than sources of authority. This paper provides an example that could be followed by other engineering faculty in setting and planning big goals for engineering students. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Active learning; and Service learning; Problem-based learning; Sustainability","Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Philosophical aspects; Planning; Sustainable development; Teaching; Active Learning; Educational experiences; Infrastructure systems; Instructor evaluations; Problem based learning; Service learning; Sustainable construction; Undergraduate students; Students",Article,"",Scopus

This trend will accelerate as demand for goods and services grows, straining resources and requiring ingenuity to replace boundless supply in meeting the needs of a more crowded, more prosperous world. Industrial engineers are uniquely positioned to incorporate sustainability concepts into this work; their focus is on systems, and in observing these systems at a high level, they can most effectively choose which parts of the systems to modify to produce desired results. In this paper, we explore using the vehicle of education to introduce sustainability concepts into industrial engineers' training. We first survey the current state of sustainability education in industrial engineering programs. We then discuss a curricular modification program in which sustainability was introduced into several courses through use of content-focused modules. We conclude with our recommendations on how such a structure can be used to expand sustainability education in industrial engineering programs at all levels.","Curriculum; Industrial engineering; Sustainability","Curricula; Education; Engineers; Industrial engineering; Personnel training; Sustainable development; Curricular modifications; Modular approach; Sustainability education; Engineering education",Article,"",Scopus

Overcoming the complex challenges of this shift will require engineers to display agility, resilience, intrinsic drive, and an ability to continually grow and develop-capacities that are currently underemphasized in engineering degree programs. Despite a growing recognition of the importance of socially responsible technological development, many engineering programs continue to prioritize decontextualized technical content learning over broad competency development. As a result, students may have difficulty identifying either personal or societal value in their engineering activities. We suggest that the integration of engineering and humanities perspectives can help students situate their technical studies within the larger human system while simultaneously offering measurable improvements in students' motivations and lifelong learning skills. In this paper, we report findings from an investigation of the effects of disciplinary integration on student motivation and learning engagement in introductory materials science courses. The quantitative results show that integrating materials science with humanities through a project-based course effectively supports increased student motivation and engagement in self-regulated learning strategies. Compared to students in nonintegrated project-based courses, students in integrated project-based courses show higher intrinsic motivation and task value. Students in the integrated materials science-history course also report significantly higher use of critical thinking strategies in their project work, indicating that an emphasis on societal context may help students cognitively engage in their engineering studies. Findings also indicate that disciplinary integration offers particular benefits to women engineering students. Compared with the non-integrated course, women in the integrated course report more significant motivational and self-regulated learning gains. This research suggests that putting human contexts at the center of engineering learning can help all engineering students, and especially women engineering students, build a sense of societal relatedness that promotes better learning. © 2015 TEMPUS Publications.","Disciplinary integration; Lifelong learning; Motivation; Project-based learning; Self-directed learning; Self-regulated learning","Education; Engineering education; Motivation; Professional aspects; Curricula; Competency development; Engineering activities; Life long learning; Project based learning; Self-directed learning; Self-regulated learning; Self-regulated learning strategies; Technological development; Disciplinary integration; Integrated programs; Learning skills; Material science; Project-based course; Student motivation; Students",Article,"",Scopus

As the session description notes, most sustainability education in engineering has to date done a thorough job ensuring student learning about the relationship between sustainability considerations and the economic bottom line, but has done far less in considerations of people and communities, rarely taking up questions of power and equity. In my presentation I draw on my experience developing, teaching, and assessing modules in collaboration with colleagues in the Engineering, Social Justice, and Peace network to integrate social justice considerations in our core courses. I reflect on lessons learned from two assignments in two different core courses, each implemented in the larger context of engineering at a liberal arts college. Here introducing a social justice dimension of sustainability was a small part of a larger effort to integrate liberal education into core courses. One module introduced students in a first year Mass and Energy Balances course to the tool of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for developing and analyzing green products and processes, while simultaneously offering a critique of green consumerism which was incorporated into student LCA projects. A key learning outcome was that students understood not only the promises of the tool but also its limitations and when it is and is not appropriately used. A second module, in Engineering Thermodynamics, sought to integrate considerations of climate change, ethics, and global economic inequality. The course, taught in the fall semester, usually overlapped with a major international climate summit. Using the 2009 Copenhagen summit as case study, students analyzed the conflict between countries in the global North and global South, with guided prompts and background reading to aid them in understanding and incorporating into their analysis the power relations evident in the climate talks, borne of histories of colonialism and present-day neoliberal economic policies. This case study was among several ethics assignments offered throughout the semester, and in some years was part of a wider exploration of global climate change. Taken as a whole, the ethics assignments and reflective engagement of students produced gains in critical thinking and reflective action, along with resistance from some students policing disciplinary boundaries of the course, opening space for motivating conversations about the syllabus in the context of the larger engineering program. The presentation concludes with some lessons learned related to design of assignments, motivation of social justice topics, scaffolding for specific social justice concepts and terminology that may be new to students, challenges of transforming an over packed curriculum, and how student resistance to topics perceived as ""not engineering"" can be a positive learning opportunity. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.",,,Conference Paper,"",Scopus

With the growth of the population worldwide and the increased demand on resources, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainable buildings. As architects, engineers and construction professionals are educated for the future, the complex area of building sustainability must be included in the curriculum; however, the literature shows no clear consensus on teaching methods or curriculum design. Growing evidence suggests that computer games could be effective tools in construction education as they can provide students with both theoretical and applied knowledge. In this paper we describe the development and initial evaluation of a serious game for learning sustainable building design principles and practices. The game is aimed at undergraduate students enrolled in Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Construction Management programs. Findings from a formative study with 17 students and three faculty show that the game was perceived as usable, engaging and useful for learning/teaching building sustainability. Results of a summative study with 42 undergraduate students show that playing the game led to an increase in subjects' declarative knowledge by 22% and procedural knowledge by 37%. Compared with traditional learning methods, playing the game led to significantly higher procedural knowledge gains, whereas gains in declarative knowledge were not significantly higher. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Assessment; Engineering education; Simulation games; Sustainability; Video game; Virtual reality","Architectural design; Curricula; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Intelligent buildings; Interactive computer graphics; Population statistics; Project management; Sustainable development; Teaching; Virtual reality; Architecture and buildings; Assessment; Construction education; Construction professionals; Simulation games; Sustainability education; Sustainable building design; Video game; Students",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

Results show that one third of the member universities offer individual courses on sustainable construction and there is significant variation in course objective, level the courses are offered and prerequisite for the courses. A matrix comparing the course objectives of the sustainable construction courses presented in this paper clearly indicates the lack of general consensus on the content of the courses and the delivery method. © 2012 ASCE.","Construction management; Curricula; Engineering education; Sustainable development; United States","Construction management; Construction professionals; Construction program; Course objectives; Delivery methods; Primary objective; Sustainability education; Sustainable construction; United States; Construction industry; Engineering education; Project management; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Curricula",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

It is now being introduced into sustainability education because of its building energy analysis and simulation applications. Preliminary evaluation of the sustainability of buildings is becoming easier, faster, and more accessible to the academic community. This new accessibility to powerful modeling software is an innovative teaching and learning tool for both instructors and students in building design and construction. The BIM modeling platform allows users to quickly identify and evaluate the impact of design and construction changes on a building's sustainability. A review of the literature revealed a very limited number of publications that addressed how this critical development can be effectively utilized in higher education. The objectives of this paper are: 1) to introduce an integrated, BIM-based building design and construction course; and 2) to demonstrate some of the teaching and learning methods, case studies, and projects used to teach sustainability in this context. The key research goal of this paper is to identify and document some methods of using BIM as an effective tool to teach sustainable building design and construction. A building design and construction class integrating BIM was developed and its initial offering was used as a case study for this paper. One feature of this class was the introduction of three different BIM software packages during a single semester, which enabled students to use BIM tools to conduct ""what-if"" sustainability analyses during design and construction scenarios. A residential and a commercial building were used as class projects to allow students to demonstrate the knowledge they had learned in class. Project results and student feedback were collected for an analysis of learning effectiveness. By incorporating case studies into the course, the authors were able to develop procedures and content appropriate for BIM-based instruction of building sustainability in a new and creative way. The preliminary results demonstrated that BIM can be used as an effective tool for teaching sustainability in a construction curriculum. The authors hope the described work will promote more discussion and additional sharing of knowledge on this important topic. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.","BIM; Building construction; Ecotect®; Education; Revit; Sustainability","Buildings; Construction; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; Intelligent buildings; Office buildings; Students; Sustainable development; Teaching; Building construction; Building energy analysis; Building Information Model - BIM; ECOTECT; Revit; Sustainability education; Sustainable building design; Teaching and learning methods; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

However, most engineering curricula still lacks the fundamentals of sustainable practices education that prepares graduating engineers to fulfill their expected roles and conduct future business in a more sustainable fashion. A more sustainable Civil Engineering curriculum requires a more systems approach to both diagnosing transport and built environment problems as well as devising solutions to such problems. This paper examines typical engineering curricula and identifies specific courses in the areas of transportation and construction where sustainability can be injected with minimum disruption to the structure of the course and/or its connection to other courses with the intended degree. For the two subspecialties, the core and elective courses are categorized and certain areas/modules within each course are identified, where the integration of sustainable engineering education is useful. Furthermore, some educational tools that facilitate the infusion of these concepts into the two subspecialties are presented. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Integrating sustainability education; Transportation and construction courses","Built environment; Civil engineering curricula; Civil engineering programs; Educational tools; Elective course; Engineering curriculum; Sustainability education; Sustainable engineering; Sustainable practices; Systems approach; Urban life; Civil engineering; Curricula; Engineering; Engineering education; Teaching; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"",Scopus

This system, called LabVIEW Enabled Watershed Assessment System (LEWAS), is a logical extension of prior data acquisition modules that have been successfully implemented using LabVIEW in the first freshman engineering course at Virginia Tech. The system will measure water quality and quantity data including flow rate, pH, dissolved Oxygen, conductivity and temperature - as indicators of stream health - for an oncampus impaired stream in real-time. In addition, weather parameters (temperature, barometric pressure, relative humidity and precipitation) are measured at the site of the lab located on the stream. LEWAS is solar powered and uses the campus wireless network through a high-gain antenna to transmit data to remote clients in real-time. Remote users can change the sampling intervals and modify the LabVIEW programs that run on the system to analyze the data with proper access privileges. Pilot applications of LEWAS have been conducted in the freshman engineering course. Students have expressed positive attitudes towards the applicability and usefulness of LabVIEW in the context of environmental monitoring and the impact of real-time monitoring on increasing their environmental awareness.

The goal of this paper was to illustrate the implementation of all these pedagogical approaches in a graduate-level sustainability engineering education class. Fink's taxonomy of significant learning and the University of Toledo's Outdoor Classroom Garden provided the framework for this implementation. Throughout the semester, sustainability engineering students worked toward an engineering solution for how to water the University of Toledo's outdoor classroom garden. They also estimated the life-cycle cost and environmental impacts of their proposed solutions.

Carbon tax, carbon pollution reduction schemes, emissions trading legislation are paving the way for environmental accountability in engineering industry. Engineering education moves into the twenty first century charged with an environmental agenda due to response to wider changes in society. Educators are regularly modifying curriculum content to embrace sustainability in learning outcomes. However this crosses over between a number of multi-disciplinary, multidimensional study areas that include philosophy and ethics. Consequently a major challenge for educators is to encourage engineering students whose primary focus is purely technical to include sustainability viewpoint in their designs. Unlike technical or financial evaluations where measures are either empirical or numerical estimates, sustainability position includes criteria in economic, natural, social, technological and time indicators. For the most part sustainability evaluations are content and competency driven and rely sometimes on rather intangible and proximal criteria. These criteria form the basis of assessment for measuring the sustainability of a design. The purpose of this article is to present various criterion, and indicators available to evaluate sustainability in engineering designs feasibility assessments. The paper presents the application of sustainability design criteria in the context of capstone design projects by way of applying social, economic, ecological, technological and time SEETT framework. These criteria form the basis of sustainability education embedment in engineering capstone design projects.
