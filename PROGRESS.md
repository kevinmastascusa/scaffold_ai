- **Generated detailed `unicode_report.txt`** with processing insights
- **Unicode analysis results**:
  - Total characters: 14,953,215
  - Unicode characters: 44,367 (0.30% - acceptable)
  - No problematic Unicode characters detected
- **Combined words analysis**:
  - Total combined words: 10,262
  - Unique combined words: 7,383
  - Sustainability-related combined words: 23,002
  - Critical terms affected: "environmentalsustainability", "sustainabilityeducation", etc.

### ‚úÖ Combined Words Issue Solved (June 2025)
- **Developed and ran a programmatic combined words analysis and post-processing pipeline.**
- **Created `postprocess_combined_words.py` and `generate_combined_words_report.py` for automated detection and cleaning.**
- **All major combined words (including sustainability-related terms) are now split or confirmed as legitimate technical terms.**
- **Final report:**
  - No camelCase or PascalCase issues remain.
  - 92% of chunks contain combined words, but these are now mostly legitimate academic/technical terms.
  - Sustainability-related combined words are now split or confirmed as valid.
- **See `outputs/combined_words_analysis_report.txt` for details.**

## Previous Progress (June 2025)

### Enhanced PDF chunking pipeline:
- Fixed indentation and syntax issues in `ChunkTest_Math.py`.
- Improved math detection regex patterns for equations, formulas, units, and statistics.
- Switched to page-based chunking (one complete page per chunk) in `ChunkTest.py`.

### Vectorization pipeline updates:
- Pointed `main.py` and `transformVector.py` to use precomputed `chunked_text_extracts.json`.
- Added `clean_for_vector` function to normalize/ch cleanup text before embedding.
- Corrected FAISS `index.add` signature to include the vector count.
- Renamed `transormVector.py` to `transformVector.py` and updated references in test scripts.

### Metadata extraction improvements:
- Strengthened DOI regex to avoid trailing text (`(?=\s|$)` lookahead).
- Added NLTK-based fallback for author extraction and improved title extraction.

### Testing and utilities:
- Created `generate_unicode_report.py` to output `unicode_report.txt` for chunked extracts.
- Updated import paths and `sys.path` insertions for test scripts.
- Cleaned up `test_vector_setup.py` to inline chunk conversion logic and remove deprecated imports.
