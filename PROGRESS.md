# Project Progress Log

**Date:** June 26, 2025

## Recent Major Improvements (June 2025)

### üèóÔ∏è Centralized Configuration System
- **Created `scaffold_core/config.py`** for centralized path management
- **Updated all 12 scripts** to use relative paths from workspace root
- **Removed all hardcoded user-specific paths** (e.g., `c:\Users\dlaev\...`)
- **Made project fully portable** for anyone who clones the repository
- **Added `setup.py`** for automated project initialization and directory creation

### üìä Comprehensive Unicode and Text Analysis
- **Processed 273 PDF documents** successfully with 4,859 chunks generated
- **Created enhanced `generate_unicode_report.py`** with comprehensive analysis
- **Generated detailed `unicode_report.txt`** with processing insights
- **Unicode analysis results**:
  - Total characters: 14,953,215
  - Unicode characters: 44,367 (0.30% - acceptable)
  - No problematic Unicode characters detected
- **Combined words analysis**:
  - Total combined words: 10,262
  - Unique combined words: 7,383
  - Sustainability-related combined words: 23,002
  - Critical terms affected: "environmentalsustainability", "sustainabilityeducation", etc.

### ‚úÖ Combined Words Issue Solved (July 2025)
- **Developed and ran a programmatic combined words analysis and post-processing pipeline.**
- **Created `postprocess_combined_words.py` and `generate_combined_words_report.py` for automated detection and cleaning.**
- **All major combined words (including sustainability-related terms) are now split or confirmed as legitimate technical terms.**
- **Final report:**
  - No camelCase or PascalCase issues remain.
  - 92% of chunks contain combined words, but these are now mostly legitimate academic/technical terms.
  - Sustainability-related combined words are now split or confirmed as valid.
- **See `outputs/combined_words_analysis_report.txt` for details.**

### üß† Vectorization Pipeline Completed (June 2025)
- **Successfully implemented and executed full vectorization pipeline**
- **Updated `requirements.txt`** with compatible dependency versions for Python 3.11
- **Resolved dependency conflicts** including sentence-transformers, transformers, tokenizers, and torch versions
- **Generated embeddings** for all 4,859 text chunks using sentence-transformers
- **Created FAISS index** for efficient similarity search and retrieval
- **Processed cleaned text data** from post-processed combined words fixes
- **Output files generated:**
  - `vector_outputs/embeddings.npy` - Numerical embeddings array
  - `vector_outputs/faiss_index.bin` - FAISS index for similarity search
  - `vector_outputs/chunk_metadata.json` - Metadata mapping for chunks
- **Vectorization completed without errors** - ready for semantic search and retrieval operations

### üìö Documentation and Setup Improvements
- **Enhanced README.md** with comprehensive getting started guide
- **Added project structure overview** and configuration explanation
- **Created automated setup process** with `python setup.py`
- **Added validation and directory creation** for new users

### üîß Technical Infrastructure
- **Updated all vector processing scripts** to use central configuration
- **Fixed import paths** across all modules
- **Added backward compatibility** for existing code
- **Implemented workspace-agnostic path resolution**

## Previous Progress (June 2024)

### Enhanced PDF chunking pipeline:
- Fixed indentation and syntax issues in `ChunkTest_Math.py`.
- Improved math detection regex patterns for equations, formulas, units, and statistics.
- Switched to page-based chunking (one complete page per chunk) in `ChunkTest.py`.

### Vectorization pipeline updates:
- Pointed `main.py` and `transformVector.py` to use precomputed `chunked_text_extracts.json`.
- Added `clean_for_vector` function to normalize/ch cleanup text before embedding.
- Corrected FAISS `index.add` signature to include the vector count.
- Renamed `transormVector.py` to `transformVector.py` and updated references in test scripts.

### Metadata extraction improvements:
- Strengthened DOI regex to avoid trailing text (`(?=\s|$)` lookahead).
- Added NLTK-based fallback for author extraction and improved title extraction.

### Testing and utilities:
- Created `generate_unicode_report.py` to output `unicode_report.txt` for chunked extracts.
- Updated import paths and `sys.path` insertions for test scripts.
- Cleaned up `test_vector_setup.py` to inline chunk conversion logic and remove deprecated imports.

## Next Steps / TODOs

### üî• High Priority
- **Implement semantic search and retrieval functionality** using the completed FAISS index
- **Create user interface for querying the vectorized knowledge base**
- **Add query performance testing and optimization**

### üîß Medium Priority
- **Integrate full Unicode analysis** into page-based chunks for `ChunkTest.py` outputs
- **Complete math-aware chunking improvements** in `ChunkTest_Math.py` and re-integrate with vector pipeline
- **Add vector query examples** in the README
- **Implement automated testing** for the configuration system
- **Create query result visualization and export functionality**

### üìà Future Enhancements
- **Add configuration validation** to catch path issues early
- **Create user-friendly error messages** for missing dependencies
- **Implement progress tracking** for long-running processes
- **Add configuration profiles** for different deployment scenarios
- **Implement advanced search features** (filters, faceted search, relevance scoring)
- **Add support for incremental updates** to the vector database

## Completed Tasks

- **Combined words issue:** Programmatic detection and post-processing implemented. All major combined words are now split or confirmed as legitimate. See July 2025 update above.
- **Vectorization pipeline:** Full embedding generation and FAISS index creation completed. Ready for semantic search operations. See June 2025 update above.
