Top Sources: C:\Users\dlaev\GitHub\scaffold_ai\data\Systematic selection - Scopus and ASEE library\The Wiley Handbook of Sustainability in Higher Education Learning and Teaching - 2022 - Gamage.pdf, C:\Users\dlaev\GitHub\scaffold_ai\data\Systematic selection - Scopus and ASEE library\The Wiley Handbook of Sustainability in Higher Education Learning and Teaching - 2022 - Gamage.pdf, C:\Users\dlaev\GitHub\scaffold_ai\data\Systematic selection - Scopus and ASEE library\how-to-address-sustainability-in-a-mechanical-engineering-program-implementation-and-challenges.pdf

Response:
Universities can implement environmental sustainability frameworks by integrating sustainability into their culture and making it an integral part of their policies and curriculum. According to Ramos (2009) and Rauen et al. (2015), developing stakeholder agency in HE sustainability initiatives is crucial for effective implementation. Steiner and Posch (2006) suggest an innovative approach using transdisciplinary case studies to solve complex, real-world problems.

Policy making is essential for sustainability implementation in higher education institutions. ABET criteria for accrediting engineering programs (Gamage, 2022) emphasize that students should be able to design systems within realistic constraints, including economic, environmental, and social considerations (Gamage, 2022, p. 25). This suggests that universities should incorporate sustainability into their engineering programs and policies.

Moreover, recognizing the interconnection between natural and social systems over time is crucial for sustainability (Education_for_flourishing_an_, 2020, p. 1). Business models, financial systems, and economic markets should serve society within natural resource limits (Education_for_flourishing_an_, 2020, p. 1). Therefore, universities should adopt frameworks and tools for Business Model Innovation for sustainability (Bansal et al., 2019) to help them work within these limits.

Furthermore, offering engineering students global perspective through experiential learning projects in wind energy and sustainability (El-Gabry and Jakobski, 2019) and engaging in international project-based service-learning programs (Ellzey et al., 2019) can help foster a culture of sustainability and prepare students for sustainable careers.

Based on the provided documentation, the carbon footprint of educational institutions can be assessed through various activities and assignments designed to make students aware of their carbon emissions and the importance of reducing them. These activities often involve calculating the carbon footprint of specific activities and exploring potential mitigation strategies.

For instance, the documentation includes an assignment from a Climate Change Freshman Seminar where students are asked to estimate the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by an activity of their choosing (Source: improving-climate-change-educational-outcomes-for-first-year-students-through-multidisciplinary-instruction.pdf). Another assignment from the same source requires students to choose a baseline activity and two mitigation changes to reduce the carbon footprint of that activity (Source: improving-climate-change-educational-outcomes-for-first-year-students-through-multidisciplinary-instruction.pdf).

Moreover, the documentation describes a case study where students were engaged in a 15-week activity to discuss climate change and its solutions, with a 100% participation rate and full class involvement (Source: feduc-09-1284593.pdf). This activity, which gained the students' interest and maintained their engagement, could also contribute to assessing the carbon footprint of educational institutions by fostering awareness and encouraging students to explore potential mitigation strategies.

In summary, the provided documentation suggests that assessing the carbon footprint of educational institutions can be achieved through activities and assignments that help students understand their carbon emissions and explore potential mitigation strategies. These activities may involve calculating carbon emissions and engaging in engineering-style thinking to make informed decisions about carbon mitigation.

Response:
Life cycle thinking can be integrated into curriculum design by incorporating sustainability principles throughout the engineering education experience. This can be achieved by offering sustainability courses that build knowledge about sustainability and provide valuable connections between sustainability concepts and engineering decisions [1]. The curriculum design should ensure appropriate coverage of sustainability topics highlighted by engineering Bodies of Knowledge and accreditation criteria [1].

A problem-oriented and project-based learning paradigm is recommended for implementing life cycle thinking in curriculum design [2]. This approach allows students to evaluate sustainability considerations in complex situations and make informed decisions [2]. Additionally, a sustainability assessment and selection process can be used to evaluate the environmental impact of various design options [3].

To measure the effectiveness of incorporating life cycle thinking into the curriculum, student comprehension can be evaluated using questionnaires [4]. This approach is efficient for large cohorts of engineering students and provides valuable insights into the impact of the curriculum on student learning [4].

Response:
Based on the provided documentation, best practices for sustainable campus management can be inferred from the discussion of sustainable engineering projects in senior design courses [1], the need for harmony and comparability in sustainability education [2], and the use of problem-based and project-based learning for sustainability [3].

Senior design courses in civil and environmental engineering programs provide an opportunity for students to apply their learning in sustainable engineering, construction management, structural design, geotechnical analysis, water management, and infrastructure [1]. These projects can contribute to sustainable campus management by promoting the application of sustainability principles in real-world contexts.

The literature review in [2] highlights the need for greater harmony, comparability, and transfer ability in sustainability education. This suggests that best practices for sustainable campus management may involve the development and implementation of consistent and effective sustainability curricula.

The use of problem-based and project-based learning for sustainability is another best practice [3]. This approach allows students to work on real-world sustainability issues and develop the skills necessary to address these challenges. For example, Ford PAS uses this pedagogy by analyzing a case study in each unit and applying sustainability principles to real-world scenarios [3].

In summary, best practices for sustainable campus management include the application of sustainability principles in senior design projects, the development and implementation of consistent and effective sustainability curricula, and the use of problem-based and project-based learning for sustainability.
